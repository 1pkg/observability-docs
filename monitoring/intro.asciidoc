{monitoring} gives you insight into the operation of {es}, Logstash, and {kib}.
All of the monitoring metrics are stored in {es}, which enables you to easily
visualize the data from {kib}. From the {kib} Monitoring UI, you can spot issues
at a glance and delve into the system behavior over time to diagnose operational
issues. In addition to the built-in status warnings, you can set up custom alerts
based on the data in the monitoring indices.
