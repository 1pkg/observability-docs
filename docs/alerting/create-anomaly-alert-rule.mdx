<Testing />

You can create an anomaly rule to alert you when either the latency, throughput, or failed transaction rate of a service is abnormal. Anomaly rules can be set at different levels: environment, service, and/or transaction type. Add actions to raise alerts via services or third-party integrations e.g. mail, Slack, Jira.

{/* Placeholder - update! */}

To create your anomaly rule:

1. Select **Manage Rules** from the **Alerts** page, and select **Create rule**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your rule, and any optional **Tags** for more granular reporting (leave blank if unsure).
1. Select the **Anomaly** rule type from the APM use case.
1. Select the appropriate **Service**, **Type**, and **Environment** (or leave **ALL** to include all options).
1. Select the desired severity (critical, major, minor, warning) from **Has anomaly with severity**.
1. Define the interval to check the rule e.g. check every 1 minute.
1. (Optional) Set up **Actions**.
1. **Save** your rule.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
You can also create an anomaly rule directly from any page within **Applications**. Click the **Alerts and rules** button, and select **Create anomaly rule**. When you create a rule this way, the **Name** and **Tags** fields will be pre-populated but you can still change these.

## Actions

You can extend your rules by connecting them to **Actions** that use the following supported built-in integrations.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Action types">
Actions are services or integrations with third-party systems that run as background tasks when rule conditions are met.

![Rule connectors](../images/alert-action-types.png)   
</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Action frequency">
After you select a connector, you must set the action frequency. You can choose to create a **Summary of alerts** on each check interval or on a custom interval. For example, you can send email notifications that summarize the new, ongoing, and recovered alerts every twelve hours.

Alternatively, you can set the action frequency to **For each alert** and specify the conditions each alert must meet for the action to run. For example, you can send an email only when the alert status changes to critical.

</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Action variables">
Use the default notification message or customize it.
You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box
and selecting from a list of available variables.

</DocAccordion>

<DocCallOut title="Note">
You can add an action to a rule at any time. You can create rules without adding actions, and you can also define multiple actions for a single rule. To add actions to rules, you must first create a connector for that service (e.g. email, external incident management system), which you can then use for different rules, each with their own action frequency. For more information on creating connectors, refer to <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilitySendCasesToAnExternalSystem">Send cases to an external system</DocLink>.

## Example

Latency anomaly rules trigger when the latency of a service is abnormal. Because some parts of an application are more important than others, and have a different tolerance for latency, we’ll target a specific transaction within a service.

Before continuing, identify the service name, transaction type, and environment that you’d like to create a latency anomaly rule for. This guide will create an alert for all services based on the following criteria:

* Service: `{your_service.name}`
* Transaction: `{your_transaction.name}`
* Environment: `{your_service.environment}`
* Severity level: critical
* Check every five minutes
* Send an alert to a Slack channel when the rule status changes

From any page in **Applications**, select **Alerts and rules** -> **Create anomaly rule**. Change the name of the rule (if you wish), but do not edit the tags.

Based on the criteria above, define the following rule details:

* **Service** - `{your_service.name}`
* **Type** - `{your_transaction.name}`
* **Environment** - `{your_service.environment}`
* **Has anomaly with severity** - `critical`
* **Check every** - `5 minutes`

Next, add a connector type. Multiple connectors can be selected, but in this example we’re interested in Slack. Select **Slack** -> **Create a connector**. Enter a name for the connector, and paste your Slack webhook URL. See Slack’s webhook documentation if you need to create one.

A default message is provided as a starting point for your alert. You can use the Mustache template syntax (i.e. `{{variable}}`) to pass additional alert values at the time a condition is detected to an action. A list of available variables can be accessed by selecting the **add variable** button.

Click **Save**. Your rule has been created and is now active!
