{/* These docs need a lot of love to make them easy to consume. */}

Alerting enables you to detect complex conditions defined by a _rule_.
When a condition is met, the rule tracks it as an _alert_ and generates one or more _actions_.

{/* TODO: Provide an overview of the different rule types available for each app. */}

For an overview of alerting concepts, go to <DocLink id="serverlessRules" />.
To configure rules and alerts in ((observability)) projects, go to <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCreateRules" /> and <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityViewAlerts" />.
