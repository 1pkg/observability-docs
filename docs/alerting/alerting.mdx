Alerting enables you to detect complex conditions defined by a **rule**
within the Logs, Infrastructure, Uptime, and APM apps. When a condition is met, the rule
tracks it as an **alert** and responds by triggering one or more **actions**.

Alerts and rules related to service level objectives (SLOs), and ((observability)) apps, including Logs, Infrastructure, Uptime, and APM, can be managed in the ((observability)) UI.
You can also manage ((observability)) app rules alongside rules for other apps from the [((kib)) Management UI](((kibana-ref))/create-and-manage-rules.html).

<div id="create-alerts-rules"></div>

## Create rules

The first step when setting up alerts is to create a rule.
To create and manage rules related to ((observability)) apps,
go to the ((observability)) **Alerts** page and click **Manage Rules** to navigate to the ((observability)) Rules page.

You can also create rules directly from the Logs, Infrastructure, Uptime, and APM apps without leaving the app by
clicking **Alerts and rules** and selecting a rule, or you can select **Manage Rules** to go to the ((observability)) Rules page.

To create SLO rules, you must first define a new SLO via the **Create new SLO** button. Once an SLO has been defined, you can create SLO rules tied to this SLO.

{/* ![Elastic ((observability)) Rules page](images/create-alerts/-observability-create-alerts-manage-rules.png) */}

<DocCallOut title="Note">
You can also centrally create and manage rules, including rules _not_ related to ((observability)), from the
[((kib)) Management UI](((kibana-ref))/create-and-manage-rules.html).
</DocCallOut>

From the ((observability)) Rules page, you can manage rules for ((observability)) apps, including:

* Creating a new rule
* Editing or deleting existing rules
* Updating the status of existing rules (Enabled, Disabled, or Snoozed indefinitely)

<DocCallOut title="Note">

The ((observability)) Rules page allows you to set a rule to be "Snoozed indefinitely".
To snooze a rule for a specific time period, you must use the centralized [((rules-ui)) page](((kibana-ref))/create-and-manage-rules.html).

<DocBadge template="technical preview" />  To temporarily suppress notifications for _all_ rules, create a [maintenance window](((kibana-ref))/maintenance-windows.html).

</DocCallOut>

Extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use built-in **connectors** for email,
((ibm-r)), Index, JIRA, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Server log, ((sn)) ITSM, Opsgenie, and Slack.
Also supported is a powerful webhook output letting you tie into other third-party systems.
Connectors allow actions to talk to these services and integrations.

## View rule details

Click on an individual rule on the Rules page to view details including the rule name, status, definition,
execution history, related alerts, and more.

You can also view rule details by clicking on individual rules in the

## View and manage alerts

The **Alerts** page lists all your
alerts that have met a condition defined by a rule you created
using one of the Observability apps.

Learn more about viewing and managing alerts in <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityViewAlerts">View alerts</DocLink>.

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
Not all the predefined rules in ((stack-manage-app)) will generate and
list an alert on the ((observability)) Alerts page.
Only alerts generated by rules relating to Logs, Infrastructure, Uptime, and APM
can be viewed on the Alerts page.

## Configure alerts

You may want to disable writing to specific ((observability)) alert indices or disable all alerts and remove the Alerts page altogether.
You can do this in ((kib)) settings.

If you are using our [hosted ((ess))](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service) on ((ecloud)),
you'll edit the ((kib)) user settings:

1. Select your deployment on the home page, and from your deployment menu go to the **Edit** page.
1. In the **((kib))** section, click **Edit user settings**, and add the desired settings (detailed below).
1. Click **Back**, and then click **Save**. The changes are automatically appended to the `kibana.yml` configuration file for your instance.

If you have a self-managed ((stack)), you'll edit the settings in your `kibana.yml` file.

<div id="create-alerts-disable-some"></div>

### Disable writing to specific alert indices

To disable writing to specific ((observability)) alerts-as-data indices
while continuing to write to others, use `xpack.ruleRegistry.write.disabledRegistrationContexts`.

You can disable writing to alert indices for:

* Logs (`observability.logs`)
* Infrastructure (`observability.metrics`)
* APM (`observability.apm`)
* Uptime (`observability.uptime`)

<DocCallOut title="Note">
Disabling writing to the indices of one of the ((observability)) apps listed above will affect _all_ rule types of the corresponding app.
For example, disabling writing to uptime alert indices will affect _all_ uptime rule types including monitor status and TLS rule types.
</DocCallOut>

For example, to disable writing to Logs alert indices, you would add the following to your ((kib)) settings:

```yml
xpack.ruleRegistry.write.disabledRegistrationContexts : ['observability.logs']
```

To disable writing to both Logs and Uptime alert indices, you would use: 

```yml
xpack.ruleRegistry.write.disabledRegistrationContexts : ['observability.logs', 'observability.uptime']
```

<div id="create-alerts-remove-page"></div>

### Remove the Alerts page

To disable writing to all alert indices and remove the Alerts page from ((kib)) altogether, use the following settings:

```yml
xpack.ruleRegistry.write.enabled: 'false'
xpack.observability.unsafe.alertingExperience.enabled: 'false'
```
