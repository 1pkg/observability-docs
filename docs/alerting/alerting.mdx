{/* TODO: Remove the details about creating rules and consolidate the info with the page that covers rules creation. */}

Alerting enables you to detect complex conditions defined by a **rule**
within the Logs, Infrastructure, Uptime, and APM apps. When a condition is met, the rule
tracks it as an **alert** and responds by triggering one or more **actions**.

<div id="create-alerts-rules"></div>

## Create rules

The first step when setting up alerts is to create a rule.
To create and manage rules,
go to the ((observability)) **Alerts** page and click **Manage Rules**.

{/* ![Elastic ((observability)) Rules page](images/create-alerts/-observability-create-alerts-manage-rules.png) */}

From the Rules page, you can:

* Create a new rule
* Edit or delete existing rules
* Update the status of existing rules (Enabled, Disabled, or Snoozed indefinitely)

<DocBadge template="technical preview" />  To temporarily suppress notifications for _all_ rules, create a [maintenance window](((kibana-ref))/maintenance-windows.html).

Extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use built-in **connectors** for email,
((ibm-r)), Index, JIRA, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Server log, ((sn)) ITSM, Opsgenie, and Slack.
Also supported is a powerful webhook output letting you tie into other third-party systems.
Connectors allow actions to talk to these services and integrations.

## View rule details

Click on an individual rule on the Rules page to view details including the rule name, status, definition,
execution history, related alerts, and more.

<div id="create-alerts-alert"></div>

## View and manage alerts

The **Alerts** page lists all your alerts that have met a condition defined by a rule you created.
