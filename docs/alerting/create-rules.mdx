The first step when setting up alerts is to create a rule.
To create and manage rules related to service level objectives (SLOs) and ((observability)) apps, go to the **Alerts** page and click **Manage Rules** to navigate to the ((observability)) **((rules-app))** page.

You can also create rules directly from the **Services**, **Traces**, and **Dependencies** apps without leaving the app by clicking **Alerts and rules** and selecting a rule, or you can select **Manage Rules** to go to the ((observability)) **((rules-app))** page.
{/*
TBD: Was "Logs, Infrastructure, Uptime, and APM apps". What's the full list in Serverless?
*/}

After a rule is created, you can open the action menu (â€¦) and select **Edit rule** to re-open the flyout and change the rule properties.

*/}

From the **((rules-app))** page, you can:

* Create, edit, and delete rules
* Configure rule settings
* Manage the status of rules
* Snooze rule notifications
* Edit rule API keys

Learn how to create specific types of rules:

* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCreateFailedTransactionRateThresholdAlertRule">Failed transaction rate threshold</DocLink>
* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCreateLatencyThresholdAlertRule">Latency threshold</DocLink>
* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCreateSloBurnRateAlertRule">SLO burn rate rule</DocLink>

## View rule details

Click on an individual rule on the **((rules-app))** page to view details including the rule name, status, definition, execution history, related alerts, and more.

{/* ![Elastic ((observability)) detail page for a single rule](images/create-alerts/-observability-create-alerts-rules-details.png) */}

A rule can have one of the following responses:

`failed`
  : The rule ran with errors.

`succeeded`
  : The rule ran without errors.

`warning`
  : The rule ran with some non-critical errors.

## Snooze and disable rules

The rule listing enables you to quickly snooze, disable, enable, or delete individual rules.
{/* For example, you can change the state of a rule: */}
{/* ![Use the rule status dropdown to enable or disable an individual rule](images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-individual-enable-disable.png) */}

When you snooze a rule, the rule checks continue to run on a schedule but the
alert will not trigger any actions. You can snooze for a specified period of
time, indefinitely, or schedule single or recurring downtimes.

{/* ![Snooze notifications for a rule](images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-snooze-panel.png) */}

When a rule is in a snoozed state, you can cancel or change the duration of
this state.

<DocBadge template="technical preview" /> To temporarily suppress notifications for _all_ rules, create a <DocLink id="serverlessMaintenanceWindows" text="maintenance window"/>.

## Import and export rules

To import and export rules, use <DocLink id="serverlessSavedObjects">((saved-objects-app))</DocLink>.

Rules are disabled on export.
You are prompted to re-enable the rule on successful import.
