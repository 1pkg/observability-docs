To create and manage rules in ((observability)) projects, go to the **Alerts** page and click **Manage Rules**.

{/*
TBD: Is it still true that only a subset of rules available from this interface? Or only if certain data types exist?

Some rules must be created within the context of an app like <DocLink id="enKibanaObservability" section="metrics">Metrics</DocLink>, <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmViewAndAnalyzeTraces">APM</DocLink>, or <DocLink id="enKibanaObservability" section="uptime">Uptime</DocLink>, but others
are generic. Generic rule types can be created in **((rules-ui))** by clicking the
**Create rule** button. This will launch a flyout that guides you through selecting
a rule type and configuring its conditions and actions. */}

After a rule is created, you can open the action menu (â€¦) and select **Edit rule** to re-open the flyout and change the rule properties.

From the **((rules-app))** page, you can:

* Create, edit, and delete rules
* Configure rule settings
* Update the status of rules (enabled, disabled, or snoozed indefinitely)

Learn how to create specific types of rules:

* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCreateLogThresholdRule">Logs threshold rule</DocLink>
* [APM rules](((kibana-ref))/apm-alerts.html)
* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCreateAnSloBurnRateAlertRule">SLO burn rate rule</DocLink>

## View rule details

Click on an individual rule on the **((rules-app))** page to view details including the rule name, status, definition, execution history, related alerts, and more.

{/* ![Elastic ((observability)) detail page for a single rule](images/create-alerts/-observability-create-alerts-rules-details.png) */}

A rule can have one of the following responses:

`failed`
  : The rule ran with errors.

`succeeded`
  : The rule ran without errors.

`warning`
  : The rule ran with some non-critical errors.

{/* 
TBD: Valid for observability rules?
If there are rule actions that failed to run successfully, you can see the details on the **History** tab.

You can suppress future actions for a specific alert by turning on the **Mute** toggle. If a muted alert no longer meets the rule conditions, it stays in the list to avoid generating actions if the conditions recur. You can also disable a rule, which stops it from running checks and clears any alerts it was tracking. You may want to disable rules that are not currently needed to reduce the load on ((kib)) and ((es)).

*/}

## Snooze and disable rules

The rule listing enables you to quickly snooze, disable, enable, or delete individual rules.
{/* For example, you can change the state of a rule: */}
{/* ![Use the rule status dropdown to enable or disable an individual rule](images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-individual-enable-disable.png) */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

When you snooze a rule, the rule checks continue to run on a schedule but the
alert will not trigger any actions. You can snooze for a specified period of
time, indefinitely, or schedule single or recurring downtimes.

{/* ![Snooze notifications for a rule](images/create-and-manage-rules/user-alerting-snooze-panel.png) */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

When a rule is in a snoozed state, you can cancel or change the duration of
this state.

<DocBadge template="technical preview" /> To temporarily suppress notifications for _all_ rules, create a <DocLink id="serverlessMaintenanceWindows" text="maintenace window"/>.

## Import and export rules

To import and export rules, use <DocLink id="serverlessSavedObjects">((saved-objects-app))</DocLink>.

Rules are disabled on export.
You are prompted to re-enable the rule on successful import.
