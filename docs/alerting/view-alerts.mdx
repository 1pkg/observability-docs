Given the experimental status of this feature, you may want to disable writing to specific ((observability)) alert indices
or disable and remove the Alerts page altogether.
For more information on configuring alerts, see <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityAlerting" section="configure-alerts">Configure alerts</DocLink>.

</DocCallOut>

The Alerts page lists all the alerts that have met a condition defined by a rule you created using
one of the Observability apps.

After alerts have been triggered, you can monitor their activity to verify they are functioning correctly.
In addition, you can filter alerts and troubleshoot each alert in their respective app.

You can also add alerts to <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCases">Cases</DocLink> to open and track potential infrastructure issues.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
You can centrally manage rules from the
[((kib)) Management UI](((kibana-ref))/create-and-manage-rules.html) that provides a
set of built-in [rule types](((kibana-ref))/rule-types.html) and
[connectors](((kibana-ref))/action-types.html) for you to use. Click **Manage Rules**.

## Filter alerts

To help you get started with your analysis faster, use the KQL bar to create structured queries using
[((kib)) Query Language](((kibana-ref))/kuery-query.html). For example, `kibana.alert.rule.name : <>`.

You can use the time filter to define a specific date and time range. By default, this filter is set to search
for the last 15 minutes.

You can also filter by alert status using the buttons below the KQL bar.
By default, this filter is set to **Show all** alerts, but you can filter to show only **Active** or **Recovered** alerts.
An alert is "Active" when the condition defined in the rule currently matches,
and an alert has "Recovered" when that condition, which previously matched, is currently no longer matching.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
There is also a "Flapping" status, which means the alert is switching repeatedly between active and recovered states.
This status is possible only if you have enabled alert flapping detection.
For each space, you can choose a look back window and threshold that are used to determine whether alerts are flapping. For example, in **((observability))** > **Alerts** > **Settings** you can specify that the alert must change status at least 6 times in the last 10 runs. If the rule has actions that run when the alert status changes, those actions are suppressed while the alert is flapping.

## View alert details

There are a few ways to inspect the details for a specific alert.

From the Alerts table, you can select <DocIcon type="expand" title="View details" /> to open the alert detail flyout to view a summary of the alert without leaving the page.
There you'll see the current status of the alert, its duration, and when it was last updated.
To help you determine what caused the alert, you can view the expected and actual threshold values, and the rule that produced the alert.

{/* ![View alert details flyout on the Alerts page](images/view-observability-alerts/-observability-view-alert-details.png) */}

To further inspect the rule:

* From the alert detail flyout, click **View rule details**.
* From the Alerts table, use the <DocIcon type="boxesHorizontal" title="More actions" /> and click **View rule details**.

To view the alert in the app that triggered it:

* From the alert detail flyout, click **View in app**.
* From the Alerts table, click the <DocIcon type="eye" title="View in app" />.

## Customize the alerts table

Use the toolbar buttons in the upper-left of the alerts table to customize the columns you want displayed:

* **Columns**: Reorder the columns.
* **_x_ fields sorted**: Sort the table by one or more columns.
* **Fields**: Select the fields to display in the table.

For example, click **Fields** and choose the `kibana.alert.maintenance_window_ids` field.
If an alert was affected by a [maintenance window](((kibana-ref))/maintenance-windows.html), its identifier appears in the new column:

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* ![Alerts table with toolbar buttons highlighted](images/view-observability-alerts/-observability-alert-table-toolbar-buttons.png) */}

You can also use the toolbar buttons in the upper-right to customize the display options or view the table in full-screen mode.

## Add alerts to cases

From the Alerts table, you can add one or more alerts to a case. Select <DocIcon type="boxesHorizontal" title="More actions" />
to add the alert to a new case or add it to an existing case. You can add an unlimited amount of alerts from any rule type.

<div id="new-case-observability-alerts"></div>

### Add an alert to a new case

To add an alert to a new case:

1. Select **Add to new case**.
1. Enter a case name, add relevant tags, and include a case description.
1. Under **External incident management system**, select a connector. If you’ve previously added one, that connector
    displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the default setting is No connector selected.

1. After you’ve completed all of the required fields, click **Create case**. A notification message confirms you successfully
    created the case. To view the case details, click the notification link or go to the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCases">Cases</DocLink> page.

<div id="existing-case-observability-alerts"></div>

### Add an alert to an existing case

To add an alert to an existing case:

1. Select **Add to existing case**.
1. From the Select case pane, select the case for which to attach an alert. A confirmation message displays
