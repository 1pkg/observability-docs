You can configure email notifications that occur when users are assigned to
cases.

For hosted ((kib)) on ((ess)):

1. Add the email addresses to the monitoring email allowlist. Follow the steps in
    [Send alerts by email](((cloud))/ec-watcher.html#ec-watcher-allowlist).

    You do not need to take any more steps to configure an email connector or update
    ((kib)) user settings, since the preconfigured Elastic-Cloud-SMTP connector is
    used by default.

For self-managed ((kib)):

1. Create a preconfigured email connector.

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    At this time, email notifications support only preconfigured connectors,
    which are defined in the `kibana.yml` file. For examples, refer to
    [Preconfigured email connector](((kibana-ref))/email-action-type.html#preconfigured-email-configuration)
    and [Configuring email connectors for well-known services](((kibana-ref))/email-action-type.html#configuring-email).
    </DocCallOut>

1. Set the `notifications.connectors.default.email` ((kib)) setting to the name of
    your email connector.

1. If you want the email notifications to contain links back to the case, you
    must configure the [server.publicBaseUrl](((kibana-ref))/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl) setting.

When you subsequently add assignees to cases, they receive an email.
