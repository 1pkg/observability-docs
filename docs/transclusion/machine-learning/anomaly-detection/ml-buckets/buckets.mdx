The ((ml-features)) use the concept of a _bucket_ to divide the time series into
batches for processing.

The _bucket span_ is part of the configuration information for an ((anomaly-job)).
It defines the time interval that is used to summarize and model the data. This
is typically between 5 minutes to 1 hour and it depends on your data
characteristics. When you set the bucket span, take into account the granularity
at which you want to analyze, the frequency of the input data, the typical
duration of the anomalies, and the frequency at which alerting is required.

{/*
The bucket span has two purposes: it dictates over what time span to look for anomalous features in data, and also determines how quickly anomalies can be detected. Choosing a shorter bucket span enables anomalies to be detected more quickly. However, there is a risk of being too sensitive to natural variations or noise in the input data. Choosing too long a bucket span can mean that interesting anomalies are averaged away. There is also the possibility that the aggregation might smooth out some anomalies based on when the bucket starts in time.

The bucket span has a significant impact on the analysis. When youâ€™re trying to determine what value to use, take into account the granularity at which you want to perform the analysis, the frequency of the input data, the duration of typical anomalies, and the frequency at which alerting is required.
