When you view your ((ml)) results, each bucket has an anomaly score. This score is
a statistically aggregated and normalized view of the combined anomalousness of
all the record results in the bucket.

The ((ml)) analytics enhance the anomaly score for each bucket by considering
contiguous buckets. This extra _multi-bucket analysis_ effectively uses a
sliding window to evaluate the events in each bucket relative to the larger
context of recent events. When you review your ((ml)) results, there is a 
`multi_bucket_impact` property that indicates how strongly the final anomaly
score is influenced by multi-bucket analysis. In ((kib)), anomalies with medium or
high multi-bucket impact are depicted in the **Anomaly Explorer** and the
**Single Metric Viewer** with a cross symbol instead of a dot. For example:

image::images/multibucketanalysis.jpg["Examples of anomalies with multi-bucket impact in ((kib))"]

In this example, you can see that some of the anomalies fall within the shaded
blue area, which represents the bounds for the expected values. The bounds are
calculated per bucket, but multi-bucket analysis is not limited by that scope.

Both the **Anomaly Explorer** and the **Single Metric Viewer** contain an 
**Anomalies** table that shows key details about each anomaly such as time, 
typical and actual values, and probability. The **Anomaly explanation** section 
helps you to interpret a given anomaly by providing further insights about its 
type, impact, and score.

If you have more than one ((anomaly-job)), you can also obtain _overall bucket_
results, which combine and correlate anomalies from multiple jobs into an
overall score. When you view the results for job groups in ((kib)), it provides
the overall bucket scores. For more information, see
[Get overall buckets API](((ref))/ml-get-overall-buckets.html).

Bucket results provide the top level, overall view of the ((anomaly-job)) and are
ideal for alerts. For example, the bucket results might indicate that at 16:05
the system was unusual. This information is a summary of all the anomalies,
pinpointing when they occurred. When you identify an anomalous bucket, you can
investigate further by examining the pertinent records.
