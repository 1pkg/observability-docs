When anomalous events occur, we want to know why. To determine the cause,
however, you often need a broader knowledge of the domain. If you have
suspicions about which entities in your data set are likely causing
irregularities, you can identify them as influencers in your ((anomaly-jobs)).
That is to say, _influencers_ are fields that you suspect contain information
about someone or something that influences or contributes to anomalies in your
data. Influencers can be any field in your data.

You can pick influencers when you create your ((anomaly-job)) by using the 
**Advanced job wizard**.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="**Requirements when using the ((ml)) APIs to pick influencers**">

* The influencer field must exist in your ((dfeed)) query or aggregation; 
    otherwise it is not included in the job analysis.

* If you use a query in your ((dfeed)): influencer fields must exist in the query 
    results in the same hit as the detector fields. ((dfeeds-cap)) process data by 
    paging through the query results; since search hits cannot span multiple indices 
    or documents, ((dfeeds)) have the same limitation.

* If you use aggregations in your ((dfeed)), it is possible to use influencers 
    that come from different indices than the detector fields. However, both indices 
    must have a date field with the same name, which you specify in the 
    `data_description`.`time_field` property for the ((dfeed)).

* Influencers do not need to be fields that are specified in your ((anomaly-job))
    detectors, though they often are.

Picking an influencer is strongly recommended for the following reasons:

* It allows you to more easily assign blame for anomalies.
* It simplifies and aggregates the results.

If you use ((kib)), the job creation wizards can suggest which fields to use as
influencers. The best influencer is the person or thing that you want to blame
for the anomaly. In many cases, categorical data fields – like users or client 
IP addresses – make excellent influencers.

The **Anomaly Explorer** in ((kib)) lists the top influencers for a job and shows 
the most influental values for every anomaly. It also enables you to filter the 
data by a given influencer. 

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
Do not pick too many influencers. For example, you generally do not need 
more than three. If you pick many influencers, the results can be overwhelming 
and there is a small overhead to the analysis.
