If you create ((anomaly-jobs)) in ((kib)), you _must_ use ((dfeeds)) to retrieve data
from ((es)) for analysis. When you create an ((anomaly-job)), you select a
((data-source)) and ((kib)) configures the ((dfeed)) for you under the covers.
{/* For a description of all the ((dfeed)) properties, see the [create ((dfeeds)) API](((ref))/ml-put-datafeed.html). */}

You can associate only one ((dfeed)) with each ((anomaly-job)). The ((dfeed)) contains
a query that runs at a defined interval (`frequency`). By default, this interval
is calculated relative to the \<\<ml-buckets,bucket span>> of the ((anomaly-job)).
If you are concerned about delayed data, you can add a delay before the query
runs at each interval. See <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enMachineLearningMlDelayedDataDetection">Handling delayed data</DocLink> */}.

((dfeeds-cap)) can also aggregate data before sending it to the ((anomaly-job)).
There are some limitations, however, and aggregations should generally be used
only for low cardinality data. See <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enMachineLearningMlConfiguringAggregation">Aggregating data for faster performance</DocLink> */}.

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">

When the ((es)) ((security-features)) are enabled, a ((dfeed)) stores the roles of the
user who created or updated the ((dfeed)) at that time. This means that if those
roles are updated, the ((dfeed)) subsequently runs with the new permissions that
are associated with the roles. However, if the userâ€™s roles are adjusted after
creating or updating the ((dfeed)), the ((dfeed)) continues to run with the
permissions that were associated with the original roles.

One way to update the roles that are stored within the ((dfeed)) without changing
any other settings is to submit an empty JSON document ({}) to the
[update ((dfeed)) API](((ref))/ml-update-datafeed.html).

If the data that you want to analyze is not stored in ((es)), you cannot use
((dfeeds)). You can however send batches of data directly to the job by using the
[post data to jobs API](((ref))/ml-post-data.html). <DocBadgeDeprecated tipContent="Deprecated in 7.11.0">7.11.0</DocBadgeDeprecated>
