Below is an example of a metric document as stored in ((es)), containing JVM metrics produced by the ((apm-java-agent)).
The document contains two related metrics: `jvm.gc.time` and `jvm.gc.count`. These are accompanied by various fields describing
the environment in which the metrics were captured: service name, host name, Kubernetes pod UID, container ID, process ID, and more.
These fields make it possible to search and aggregate across various dimensions, such as by service, host, and Kubernetes pod.
