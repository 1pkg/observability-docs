### Elastic APM Ruby agent

The Elastic APM Ruby agent auto-instruments supported technologies and records interesting events,
like HTTP requests and database queries. To do this, it uses relevant public APIs when they are provided by the libraries. Otherwise, it carefully wraps the necessary internal methods.
This means that for the supported technologies, there are no code changes required.

The Agent automatically keeps track of queries to your data stores to measure their duration and metadata (like the DB statement),
as well as HTTP-related information (like the URL, parameters, and headers).

These events, called Transactions and Spans, are sent to Elastic, where they're transformed, stored, and ready to be visualized.
