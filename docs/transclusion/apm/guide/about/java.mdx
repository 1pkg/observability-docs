The Elastic APM Java agent auto-instruments supported technologies and records interesting events,
like spans for database queries and transactions for incoming HTTP requests.
To do this, it leverages the capability of the JVM to instrument the bytecode of classes.
This means that for the supported technologies, there are no code changes required.

Spans are grouped in transactionsâ€”by default, one for each incoming HTTP request.
But it's possible to create custom transactions not associated with an HTTP request.
Transactions and Spans are sent to Elastic, where they're transformed, stored, and ready to be visualized.
