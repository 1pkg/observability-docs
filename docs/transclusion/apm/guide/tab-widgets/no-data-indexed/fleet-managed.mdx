**Are the URL and API key correct?**

{/* make sure URL and API key are correct (incl API key perms) */}

**Can the ((apm-agent)) connect to APM Server?**

To determine if the ((apm-agent)) can connect to the APM Server, send requests to the instrumented service and look for lines
containing `[request]` in the APM Server logs.

If no requests are logged, confirm that:

1. SSL isn't misconfigured.
1. The host is correct. For example, if you're using Docker, ensure a bind to the right interface (for example, set
    `apm-server.host = 0.0.0.0:8200` to match any IP) and set the `SERVER_URL` setting in the ((apm-agent)) accordingly.

If you see requests coming through the APM Server but they are not accepted (a response code other than `202`),
see <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmTroubleshooting" section="common-repsonse-codes">APM Server response codes</DocLink> to narrow down the possible causes.

**Are there instrumentation gaps?**

APM agents provide auto-instrumentation for many popular frameworks and libraries.
If the ((apm-agent)) is not auto-instrumenting something that you were expecting, data won't be sent to the ((stack)).
Reference the relevant [((apm-agent)) documentation](((apm-agents-ref))/index.html) for details on what is automatically instrumented.
