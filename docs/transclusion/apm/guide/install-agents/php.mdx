**Install the agent**

Install the PHP agent using one of the [published packages](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-php/releases).

To use the RPM Package (RHEL/CentOS and Fedora):

```php
rpm -ivh <package-file>.rpm
```

To use the DEB package (Debian and Ubuntu):

```php
dpkg -i <package-file>.deb
```

To use the APK package (Alpine):

```php
apk add --allow-untrusted <package-file>.apk
```

{/* If you canâ€™t find your distribution,
you can install the agent by <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsPhpGetStarted">building it from the source</DocLink>. */}

**Configure the agent**

Configure your agent inside of the `php.ini` file:

```ini
elastic_apm.service_name="<your-service-name>" [^1]
elastic_apm.api_key="<your-api-key>" [^2]
elastic_apm.server_url="<your-server-url>" [^3]
elastic_apm.environment="<your-environment>" [^4]
```
[^1]: The service name is the primary filter in the Applications UI and is used to group errors and trace data together. Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, and space.
[^2]: Used to ensure that only your agents can send data to your project.
[^3]: Set the custom APM Server URL (default: http://localhost:8200). The URL must be fully qualified, including protocol (http or https) and port.
[^4]: The name of the environment this service is deployed in, for example, "production" or "staging". Environments allow you to easily filter data on a global level in the Applications UI. It's important to be consistent when naming environments across agents.
