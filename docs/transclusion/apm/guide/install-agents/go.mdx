**Install the agent**

Install the ((apm-agent)) packages for Go.

```go
go get go.elastic.co/apm
```

**Configure the agent**

Agents are libraries that run inside of your application process.
APM services are created programmatically based on the executable file name, or the `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable.

```go
# Initialize using environment variables:

export ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME=<your-service-name>
export ELASTIC_APM_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL=<your-apm-endpoint>
export ELASTIC_APM_ENVIRONMENT=<your-environment>
```

**Instrument your application**

Instrument your Go application by using one of the provided instrumentation modules or by using the tracer API directly.

```go
import (
	"net/http"

	"go.elastic.co/apm/module/apmhttp"
)

func main() {
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	...
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", apmhttp.Wrap(mux))
}
```
