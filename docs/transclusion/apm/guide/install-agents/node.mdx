**Install the ((apm-agent))**

Install the ((apm-agent)) for Node.js as a dependency to your application.

```js
npm install elastic-apm-node --save
```

**Configure the agent**

Agents are libraries that run inside of your application process. APM services are created programmatically based on the `serviceName`.
This agent supports a variety of frameworks but can also be used with your custom stack.

```js
// Add this to the very top of the first file loaded in your app
var apm = require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  serviceName: '<your-service-name>',
  apiKey: '<your-api-key>',
  serverUrl: '<your-apm-endpoint>',
  environment: '<your-environment>'
})
```
