By default, the Node.js agent will watch for uncaught exceptions and send them to Elastic APM automatically.
But in most cases, errors are not thrown but returned via a callback,
caught by a promise,
or simply manually created.
Those errors will not automatically be sent to Elastic APM.
To manually send an error to Elastic APM,
simply call `apm.captureError()` with the error:

```js
var err = new Error('Ups, something broke!')

apm.captureError(err)
```

For advanced logging of errors,
including adding extra metadata to the error,
