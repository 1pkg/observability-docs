When viewing the performance metrics of your application in Elastic APM,
you might see some transactions named "unknown route".
This indicates that the agent detected an incoming HTTP request to your application,
but didn't know which route in your {props.framework} app the HTTP request matched.

This might simply be 404 requests,
which by definition don't match any route,
or it might be a symptom that the agent wasn't installed correctly.
If you see this or can't get any meaningful metrics to show up,
please follow the <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enApmAgentNodejsTroubleshooting">Troubleshooting Guide</DocLink> */}.
