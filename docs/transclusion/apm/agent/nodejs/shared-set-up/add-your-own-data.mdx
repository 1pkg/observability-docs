The Node.js agent will keep track of the active HTTP request and will link it to errors and recorded transaction metrics when they are sent to the Elastic APM server.
This allows you to see details about which request resulted in a particular error or which requests cause a certain HTTP endpoint to be slow.

But in many cases,
information about the HTTP request itself isn't enough.
To add even more metadata to errors and transactions,
use one of the functions below:

* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsNodejsApi" section="apmsetusercontextcontext">`apm.setUserContext()`</DocLink> - Call this to enrich collected performance data and errors with information about the user/client
* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsNodejsApi" section="apmsetcustomcontextcontext">`apm.setCustomContext()`</DocLink> - Call this to enrich collected performance data and errors with any information that you think will help you debug performance issues and errors (this data is only stored, but not indexed in Elasticsearch)
* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsNodejsApi" section="apmsetlabelname-value[-stringify-=-true]">`apm.setLabel()`</DocLink> - Call this to enrich collected performance data and errors with simple key/value strings that you think will help you debug performance issues and errors (labels are indexed in Elasticsearch)
