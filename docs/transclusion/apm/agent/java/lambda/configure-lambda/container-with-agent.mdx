Environment variables configured for an AWS Lambda function are passed to the container running the lambda function.
You can use one of the other options (through AWS Web Console, AWS CLI, etc.) to configure the environment variables
or [define them directly in your Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env).

We recommend to use an [official AWS Lambda base image](https://gallery.ecr.aws/lambda/java) for your function's container image.
In this case, you will only need to configure the following three environment variables:

```bash
AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER       = "/opt/elastic-apm-handler"
ELASTIC_APM_LAMBDA_APM_SERVER = <YOUR-APM-SERVER-URL>     # this is your APM Server URL
ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN      = <YOUR-APM-SECRET-TOKEN>   # this is your APM secret token
ELASTIC_APM_SEND_STRATEGY     = "background"
```

If your container image is based on a different base image (not including the AWS Lambda runtime utilities),
the `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER` configuration option won't be supported. In this case, you will need to define an extended
set of environment variables (which, in the above case, are set through the wrapper script):

```bash
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS              = "-javaagent:/opt/elastic-apm-agent.jar"
ELASTIC_APM_AWS_LAMBDA_HANDLER = <HANDLER_CLASS_NAME> # the fully qualified class name of your Lambda handler
ELASTIC_APM_METRICS_INTERVAL   = "0s"
ELASTIC_APM_CENTRAL_CONFIG     = "false"
ELASTIC_APM_CLOUD_PROVIDER     = "none"
ELASTIC_APM_LAMBDA_APM_SERVER  = <YOUR-APM-SERVER-URL>     # this is your APM Server URL
ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN       = <YOUR-APM-SECRET-TOKEN>   # this is your APM secret token
ELASTIC_APM_SEND_STRATEGY      = "background"
```
