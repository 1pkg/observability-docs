Java agent releases are published as Docker images  through the `docker.elastic.co` registry.

The `latest` tag allows to use the most recent release at the time the image is built.

Adding the following statement in `Dockerfile` will copy the agent jar to `/elastic-apm-agent.jar`.

```
COPY --from=docker.elastic.co/observability/apm-agent-java:latest /usr/agent/elastic-apm-agent.jar /elastic-apm-agent.jar
```
