Java agent releases are published to [Maven central](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/), in order to get a copy you can either:

- download manually the [latest agent](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=releases&g=co.elastic.apm&a=elastic-apm-agent&v=LATEST)
or [previous releases](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/co.elastic.apm/elastic-apm-agent) from Maven central.
- download with `curl`:

```bash
curl -o 'elastic-apm-agent.jar' -L 'https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=releases&g=co.elastic.apm&a=elastic-apm-agent&v=LATEST'
```

In addition, we also publish a dedicated build of the Java agent which ships the latest log4j2 version and for that reason requires at least Java 8.
This build can also be found on [Maven central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/co.elastic.apm/elastic-apm-agent-java8/latest).
