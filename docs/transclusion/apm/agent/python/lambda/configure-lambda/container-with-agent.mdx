Environment variables configured for an AWS Lambda function are passed to the container running the lambda function.
You can use one of the other options (through AWS Web Console, AWS CLI, etc.) to configure the following environment variables:

```bash
AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER       = /opt/python/bin/elasticapm-lambda  # use this exact fixed value
ELASTIC_APM_LAMBDA_APM_SERVER = <YOUR-APM-SERVER-URL>     # this is your APM Server URL
ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN      = <YOUR-APM-SECRET-TOKEN>   # this is your APM secret token
ELASTIC_APM_SEND_STRATEGY     = background
```
