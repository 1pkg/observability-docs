Change point detection uses the
[change point aggregation](((ref))/search-aggregations-change-point-aggregation.html)
to detect distribution changes, trend changes, and other statistically
significant change points in a metric of your time series data.

You can find change point detection under **((ml-app))** > **AIOps Labs** where
you can select the ((data-source)) or saved search that you want to analyze.

Select a function and a metric field, then pick a date range to start detecting
change points in the defined range. Optionally, you can split the data by a
field. If the cardinality of the split field exceeds 10,000, then only the first
10,000, sorted by document count, are analyzed. You can configure a maximum of 6
combinations of a function applied to a metric field, partitioned by a split
field to identify change points.

When a change point is detected, a row displays basic information including the
timestamp of the change point, a preview chart, the type of change point, its
p-value, the name and value of the split field. You can further examine the
selected change point in a detailed view. A chart visualizes the identified
change point within the analyzed time window, making the interpretation easier.
If the analysis is split by a field, a separate chart is shown for every
partition that has a detected change point. The chart displays the type of
change point, its value, and the timestamp of the bucket where the change point
has been detected. The corresponding `p-value` indicates the magnitude of the
change; lower values indicate more significant changes. You can use the change
point type selector to filter the results by specific types of change points.

You can attach change point charts to a dashboard or a case by using the context
menu. If the split field is selected, you can either select specific charts
(partitions) or set the maximum number of top change points to plot. It's
possible to preserve the applied time range or use the time bound from the page
date picker. You can also add or edit change point charts directly from the
