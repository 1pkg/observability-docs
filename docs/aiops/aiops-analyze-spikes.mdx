## Log rate analysis

<DocCallOut template="technical_preview" />
Log rate analysis is a feature that uses advanced statistical methods to
identify reasons for increases or decreases in log rates. It makes it easy to
find and investigate causes of unusual spikes or drops by using the analysis
workflow view. Examine the histogram chart of the log rates for a given
((data-source)), and find the reason behind a particular change possibly in
millions of log events across multiple fields and values.

You can find log rate analysis under **((ml-app))** > **AIOps Labs** where
you can select the ((data-source)) or saved search that you want to analyze.

Select a spike or drop in the log event histogram chart to start the analysis. It
identifies statistically significant field-value combinations that contribute to
the spike or drop and displays them in a table. You can optionally choose to summarize
the results into groups. The table also shows an indicator of the level of
impact and a sparkline showing the shape of the impact in the chart. Hovering
over a row displays the impact on the histogram chart in more detail. You can
inspect a field in **Discover**, further investigate in **Log pattern analysis**,
or copy the table row information as a query filter to the clipboard by
selecting the corresponding option under the **Actions** column. You can also
pin a table row by clicking on it then move the cursor to the histogram chart.
It displays a tooltip with exact count values for the pinned field which enables
closer investigation.

Brushes in the chart show the baseline time range and the deviation in the
analyzed data. You can move the brushes to redefine both the baseline and the
deviation and rerun the analysis with the modified values.
