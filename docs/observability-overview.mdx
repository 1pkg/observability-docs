((observability)) provides granular insights and context into the behavior of applications running in your environments.
It's an important part of any system that you build and want to monitor.
Being able to detect and fix root cause events quickly within an observable system is a minimum requirement for any analyst.

Elastic ((observability)) provides a single stack to unify your logs, metrics, and application traces.
Ingest your data directly to ((es)), where you can further process and enhance the data,
before visualizing it and adding alerts.

## Application performance monitoring (APM)

Instrument your code and collect performance data and errors at runtime by installing APM agents
like Java, Go, .NET, and many more.

## Log monitoring

Analyze log data from your hosts, services, Kubernetes, Apache, and many more.

## Alerting

Stay aware of potential issues in your environments with ((observability))â€™s alerting
and actions feature that integrates with log monitoring and APM. 
It provides a set of built-in actions and specific threshold rules
and enables central management of all rules.

On the **Alerts** page, the **Alerts** table provides a snapshot of alerts occurring within the specified time frame. The table includes the alert status, when it was last updated, the reason for the alert, and more.

You can then see more details on these alerts by clicking **Show alerts**.
