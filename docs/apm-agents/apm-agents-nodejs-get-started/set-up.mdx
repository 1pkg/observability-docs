To get you off the ground, we've prepared guides for setting up the Agent with a few different popular web frameworks and technologies:

{/* This tagged region is used throughout the documentation to link to the framework guides */}
{/* Updates made here will be applied elsewhere as well. */}

{/* <WebFrameworksList  /> */}
