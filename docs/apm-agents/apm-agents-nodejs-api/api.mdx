The API reference documentation is divided into three parts:

* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsNodejsApi">The `Agent` API</DocLink> - All functions and properties on the `Agent` object.
    An instance of the `Agent` object is acquired by requiring/importing the Node.js APM Agent module.
    The `Agent` is a singleton and the instance is usually referred to by the variable `apm` in this documentation

* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsNodejsApi">The `Transaction` API</DocLink> - All functions and properties on the `Transaction` object.
    An instance of the `Transaction` object is acquired by calling `apm.startTransaction()`

* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsNodejsApi">The `Span` API</DocLink> - All functions and properties on the `Span` object.
    An instance of the `Span` object is acquired by calling `apm.startSpan()`
