There are three different ways enhance the out-of-the-box instrumentation of the Java agent with manual instrumentation:

1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsJavaApi">Public API</DocLink>
    A simple and stable API that is most native to the agent.
    Contains annotations to declaratively create spans.

1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsJavaApi">OpenTelemetry bridge</DocLink>
    A vendor neutral API.
    If you plan to do a lot of manual instrumentation and want to reduce vendor lock-in this is probably what you're looking for.

1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsJavaApi">OpenTracing bridge</DocLink>
    A vendor neutral API that is discontinued in favor of OpenTelemetry.

A further option is the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsJavaApi">plugin api</DocLink> which uses the OpenTelemetry API and allows you to add in custom instrumentation without modifying the application.

<div id="apis-operation-modes"></div>

### Operation Modes

All APIs allow for different operation modes in combination with the Elastic APM agent

Noop 
    : If the agent is not installed, the APIs are in noop mode and do not actually record and report spans.

    Mix and Match 

        If you want to leverage the auto instrumentation of Elastic APM,
        but also want to create custom spans or use the API to add custom labels to the spans created by Elastic APM,
        you can just do that.

    Manual instrumentation 

        If you don't want Elastic APM to auto-instrument known frameworks,
        but instead only rely on manual instrumentation,
        disable the auto instrumentation setting the configuration option <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsJavaConfigure" section="instrument-added[100changing-this-value-at-runtime-is-possible-since-version-1150]">`instrument`</DocLink> to `false`.
