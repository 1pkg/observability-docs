<DocCallOut title="Note">
OpenTracing is discontinued in favor of OpenTelemetry. Consider using the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsJavaApi">OpenTelemetry bridge</DocLink> instead.
Latest supported OpenTracing version: 0.33 (as of agent and OpenTracing-bridge version 1.9.0)
</DocCallOut>

The Elastic APM OpenTracing bridge allows creating Elastic APM `Transactions` and `Spans`,
using the OpenTracing API.
In other words,
it translates the calls to the OpenTracing API to Elastic APM and thus allows for reusing existing instrumentation.

The first span of a service will be converted to an Elastic APM
[`Transaction`](((apm-guide-ref))/data-model-transactions.html),
subsequent spans are mapped to Elastic APM
[`Span`](((apm-guide-ref))/data-model-spans.html).

<div id="opentracing-getting-started"></div>

### Getting started
The first step in getting started with the OpenTracing API bridge is to declare a dependency to the API:

<p id="pomxml"><strong>pom.xml</strong></p>

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.elastic.apm</groupId>
    <artifactId>apm-opentracing</artifactId>
    <version>${elastic-apm.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

<p id="buildgradle"><strong>build.gradle</strong></p>

```groovy
compile "co.elastic.apm:apm-opentracing:$elasticApmVersion"
```

Replace the version placeholders with the
[latest version from maven central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/co.elastic.apm/apm-opentracing/latest):

<div id="init-tracer"></div>

### Initialize tracer

```java
import co.elastic.apm.opentracing.ElasticApmTracer;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;

Tracer tracer = new ElasticApmTracer();
```

Since version 1.22.0, the OpenTracing bridge supports `Tracer` lookup and initialization through the ServiceLoader mechanism.
An example for a system that relies on this capability is [tracer-resolver](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-tracerresolver),
which is used by various OpenTracing libraries, for example the
[Apache Camel OpenTracing component](https://camel.apache.org/components/3.7.x/others/opentracing.html).
When such is used, no code changes are required, only the addition of dependencies for the OpenTracing library and
the Elastic OpenTracing bridge.

<div id="opentracing-elastic-apm-tags"></div>

### Elastic APM specific tags

Elastic APM defines some tags which are not included in the OpenTracing API but are relevant in the context of Elastic APM.

- `type` - sets the type of the transaction/span,
  for example `request`, `ext` or `db`
- `subtype` - sets the subtype of the span,
  for example `http`, `mysql` or `jsf`
- `action` - sets the action related to a span,
  for example `query`, `execute` or `render`
- `user.id` - sets the user id,
  appears in the "User" tab in the transaction details in the Elastic APM app
- `user.email` - sets the user email,
  appears in the "User" tab in the transaction details in the Elastic APM app
- `user.username` - sets the user name,
  appears in the "User" tab in the transaction details in the Elastic APM app
- `result` - sets the result of the transaction. Overrides the default value of `success`.
  If the `error` tag is set to `true`, the default value is `error`.
  Setting `http.status_code` to `200`, for example, implicitly sets the result to `HTTP 2xx` if not explicitly set otherwise.

<div id="opentracing-unsupported"></div>

### Caveats
Not all features of the OpenTracing API are supported.

<div id="opentracing-propagation"></div>

#### Context propagation
This bridge only supports the formats `Format.Builtin.TEXT_MAP` and `Format.Builtin.HTTP_HEADERS`.
`Format.Builtin.BINARY` is currently not supported.

<div id="opentracing-references"></div>

#### Span References
Currently, this bridge only supports `child_of` references.
Other references,
like `follows_from` are not supported yet.

<div id="opentracing-baggage"></div>

#### Baggage
The `Span.setBaggageItem(String, String)` method is not supported.
Baggage items are silently dropped.

<div id="opentracing-logs"></div>

#### Logs
Only exception logging is supported.
Logging an Exception on the OpenTracing span will create an Elastic APM
[`Error`](((apm-guide-ref))/data-model-errors.html).
Example:

```java
Exception e = ...
span.log(
    Map.of(
        "event", "error",
        "error.object", e
    )
)
```

Other logs are silently dropped.
