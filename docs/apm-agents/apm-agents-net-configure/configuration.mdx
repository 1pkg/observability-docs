Utilize configuration options to adapt the Elastic APM agent to your needs. There are multiple configuration sources, each with different naming conventions for the property key.

By default, the agent uses environment variables. Additionally, on ASP.NET Core, the agent can plug into the [Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-2.2) infrastructure.

### Dynamic configuration

Configuration options that are marked with the <DocBadge>Dynamic</DocBadge> badge can be changed at runtime
when set from a supported source.

The .NET Agent supports [Central configuration](((apm-app-ref))/agent-configuration.html),
which allows you to fine-tune certain configurations via the APM app.
This feature is enabled in the Agent by default, with <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsNetConfigure" section="centralconfig-added[11]">`CentralConfig` (added[1.1])</DocLink>.
