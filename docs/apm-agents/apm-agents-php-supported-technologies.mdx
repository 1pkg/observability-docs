If the agent doesn't support your favorite technology yet,
you can vote for it by participating in [our survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8c3BJVMqaeuqpq-t3_Q4NilNcdsrzK1qJ4Qo9JpJslrmYzA/viewform).
We will use the results to add support for the most requested technologies.

<div id="supported-os"></div>

## Operating systems

<div id="supported-php-versions"></div>

## PHP versions

<div id="supported-web-frameworks"></div>

## Web frameworks

Automatic instrumentation for a web framework means
a transaction is automatically created for each incoming request and it is named after the registered route.

We support automatic instrumentation for the following web frameworks.

| Framework | Supported versions |
|---|---|
| Framework-less PHP application (i.e., application using PHP's built in web support) |  |
| Laravel | 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 |
| WordPress | 5, 6 |

<div id="supported-data-access-technologies"></div>

## Data access technologies

We support automatic instrumentation for the following data access technologies.

| Data access technology | Supported versions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PHP Data Objects (PDO) | any version bundled with a supported PHP version | The agent automatically creates DB spans for all your PDO queries. This includes PDO queries executed by object relational mappers (ORM) like Doctrine & Eloquent. |
| MySQLi | any version bundled with a supported PHP version |  |

<div id="supported-http-clients"></div>

## HTTP clients

Automatic instrumentation for an HTTP client technology means
an HTTP span is automatically created for each outgoing HTTP request
and distributed tracing headers are propagated.
The spans are named after the schema `<method> <host>`, for example `GET elastic.co`.

| Framework | Supported versions |
|---|---|
| `curl` extension |  |
| `Guzzle` library |  |

<div id="supported-php-errors"></div>

## Capturing PHP errors as APM error events

The agent automatically creates APM error events for PHP errors triggered by the monitored application.
See <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsPhpConfigure" section="php-errors-as-apm-error-events">PHP errors as APM error events</DocLink> for the relevant configuration settings.
