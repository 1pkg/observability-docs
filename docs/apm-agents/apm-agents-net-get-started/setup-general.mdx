If you have a .NET application that is not covered in this section, you can still use the agent and instrument your application manually.

To do this, add the [Elastic.Apm]({nuget}/Elastic.Apm) package to your application and use the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentsNetApi">Public API</DocLink> to manually create spans and transactions.
