== Breaking Changes

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application from one version of {xpack} to another.

As a general rule, we strive to keep backwards compatibility between minor
versions (for example, 7.x to 7.y), but there might be breaking changes between
major versions (for example, 6.x to 7.y). Breaking changes are also listed at
the top of the <<xpack-release-notes,release notes>> for each version.
