<DocCallOut title="Tip">
Traces link together related transactions to show an end-to-end performance of how a request was served
and which services were part of it.
In addition to the Traces overview, you can view your application traces in the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmTraceSampleTimeline">trace sample timeline waterfall</DocLink>.
</DocCallOut>

**Traces** displays your application's entry (root) transactions.
Transactions with the same name are grouped together and only shown once in this table.
If you're using <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmTraceSampleTimeline" section="distributed-tracing">distributed tracing</DocLink>,
this view is key to finding the critical paths within your application.

By default, transactions are sorted by _Impact_.
Impact helps show the most used and slowest endpoints in your service &mdash; in other words,
it's the collective amount of pain a specific endpoint is causing your users.
If there's a particular endpoint you're worried about, select it to view its
<DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmTransactions" section="transaction-details">transaction details</DocLink>.

## Trace explorer

<DocCallOut template="technical_preview" />
**Trace explorer** is an experimental top-level search tool that allows you to query your traces using [Kibana Query Language (KQL)](((kibana-ref))/kuery-query.html) or [Event Query Language (EQL)](((ref))/eql.html).

Curate your own custom queries, or use the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmServiceMap" /> to find and select edges to automatically generate queries based on your selection:
