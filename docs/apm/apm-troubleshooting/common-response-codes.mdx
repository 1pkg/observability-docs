### HTTP 400: Data decoding error / Data validation error

The most likely cause for this error is using incompatible versions of ((apm-agent)) and APM Server.
See the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmAgentCompatibility">agent/server compatibility matrix</DocLink> to verify compatibility.

### HTTP 400: Event too large

APM agents communicate with the APM server by sending events in an HTTP request. Each event is sent as its own line in the HTTP request body. If events are too large, you should consider increasing the <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enApmGuideConfigurationProcess" section="max-event-size">Max event size</DocLink> */}
setting in the APM integration, and adjusting relevant settings in the agent.

### HTTP 401: Invalid token

The API key is invalid.

### HTTP 503: Request timed out waiting to be processed

This happens when APM Server exceeds the maximum number of requests that it can process concurrently.
To alleviate this problem, you can try to: reduce the sample rate and/or reduce the collected stack trace information.
See <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmReduceStorage">Reduce storage</DocLink> for more information.

Another option is to increase processing power.
This can be done by either migrating your ((agent)) to a more powerful machine
or adding more APM Server instances.
