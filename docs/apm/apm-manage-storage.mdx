((agent)) uses <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmDataStreams">data streams</DocLink> to store time series data across multiple indices.
Each data stream ships with a customizable <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmIndexLifecycleManagement">index lifecycle policy</DocLink> that automates data retention as your indices grow and age.

The <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmStorageAndSizingGuide">storage and sizing guide</DocLink> attempts to define a "typical" storage reference for Elastic APM,
and there are additional settings you can tweak to <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmReduceStorage">reduce storage</DocLink>,
or to <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enApmGuideTuneDataIngestion" section="tune-((es))">tune data ingestion in ((es))</DocLink> */}.

In addition, the APM UI makes it easy to visualize your APM data usage with
[storage explorer](((kibana-ref))/storage-explorer.html).
Storage explorer allows you to analyze the storage footprint of each of your services to see
which are producing large amounts of data--so you can better reduce the data you're collecting
or forecast and prepare for future storage needs.
