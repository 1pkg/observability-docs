APM agents are written in the same language as your service.
To monitor a new service, you must install the agent and configure it with a service name,
APM Server host, and Secret token.

* **Service name**: The APM integration maps an instrumented service's name–defined in each ((apm-agent))'s configuration–
    to the index that its data is stored in ((es)).
    Service names are case-insensitive and must be unique.
    For example, you cannot have a service named `Foo` and another named `foo`.
    Special characters will be removed from service names and replaced with underscores (`_`).

* **APM Server URL**: The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.
    This should match the host and port defined when setting up the APM integration.

* **Secret token**: Authentication method for ((apm-agent)) and APM Server communication.
    This should match the secret token defined when setting up the APM integration.
