In this guide you'll learn how to collect and send Application Performance Monitoring (APM) data
to Elastic, then explore and visualize the data in real-time.

## Step 1: Add data

You'll use APM agents to send APM data from your application to Elastic. Elastic offers APM agents
written in several languages and supports OpenTelemetry. Which agent you'll use depends on the language used in your service.

To send APM data to Elastic, you must install an APM agent and configure it to send data to
your project. While there are many configuration options, all APM agents use:

<DocTable columns={[
  { title: 'Option', width: '25%' },
  { title: 'Description', width: '75%' }
]}>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Service name**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      The APM integration maps an instrumented service's name &mdash; defined in
      each ((apm-agent))'s configuration &mdash; to the index where its data is stored in ((es)).
      Service names are case-insensitive and must be unique.
      
      For example, you cannot have a service named `Foo` and another named `foo`.
      Special characters will be removed from service names and replaced with underscores (`_`).
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**APM Server URL**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.
      
      If you're following the step-by-step instructions in the UI, the server URL will be prepopulated in
      the code snippet that's provided.
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**API key**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      Authentication method for ((apm-agent)) and APM Server communication.
      
      You can create and delete API keys in Applications Settings. Go to any page in the
      **Application** section of the main menu, click **Settings** in the top bar, and go
      to the **APM agent keys** tab.

      Alternatively, if you're following the step-by-step instructions in the UI and click **Create API Key**,
      the API key will be prepopulated in the code snippet.
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Environment**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      The name of the environment this service is deployed in, for example "production" or "staging".

      Environments allow you to easily filter data on a global level in the UI.
      It's important to be consistent when naming environments across agents.
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
</DocTable>

To start sending APM data to Elastic:

1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCreateAnObservabilityProject">Create a new ((observability)) project</DocLink>, or open an existing one.
1. To install and configure one or more APM agents you can either go to **Add data** -> **Collect application performance monitoring data** and follow the prompts in the UI, or use the instructions below:

    <DocTabs hasBorder>
      <DocTab name="Java"><Java /></DocTab>
      <DocTab name="Node.js"><Node /></DocTab>
      <DocTab name="Python"><Python /></DocTab>
      <DocTab name="Ruby"><Ruby /></DocTab>
      <DocTab name="Go"><Go /></DocTab>
      <DocTab name=".NET"><Net /></DocTab>
      <DocTab name="PHP"><Php /></DocTab>
      <DocTab name="OpenTelemetry"><OpenTelemetry /></DocTab>
    </DocTabs>

    <br />

1. If you're using the step-by-step instructions in the UI, after you've installed and configured an agent,
you can click **Check Agent Status** to verify that the agent is sending data.

## Step 2: View your data

After one or more APM agents are installed and successfully sending data, you can view
application performance monitoring data in the UI:

1. Click **Applications** in the main menu.
1. Select **Services** to see a high-level overview of the health and general
   performance of all your services.
