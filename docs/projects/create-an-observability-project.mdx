Create a project when you want to run Elastic ((observability)) in an autoscaled and fully-managed environment,
where you don't have to manage the underlying ((es)) cluster or ((kib)) instances.
Want more control over managing your stack? [Create a deployment instead](((cloud))/ec-create-deployment.html).

To create an ((observability)) project:

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and log in to your ((ecloud)) account.

1. Under **Observability**, click **Next**.
1. Enter a name for your project.
1. (Optional) Edit your project settings:
    * **Cloud provider**: The cloud platform where youâ€™ll deploy your project.
    * **Region**: The region where your project will live. The region should be as close as possible to the location of your data.
