<div id="logs-stream"></div>

In this guide, you'll learn how to send a log file to Elasticsearch using a standalone ((agent)), configure the ((agent)) and your data streams using the `elastic-agent.yml` file, and query your logs using the data streams you've set up. Once your log files are in ((es)), see the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="get-the-most-out-of-your-log-data">Get the most out of your log data</DocLink> section to learn how to parse your log data and extract fields so you can filter and sort your logs effectively.

<div id="logs-stream-prereq"></div>

{/* Prereqs removed because they are not relevant to serverless. */}

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have access to an Observability serverless project.
<DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCreateAnObservabilityProject" text="Create an observability project"/> if you don't already have one.

<div id="logs-stream-install-config-agent"></div>

## Install and configure the standalone ((agent))

Complete these steps to install and configure the standalone ((agent)) and send your log data to ((es)):

1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="step-1-download-and-extract-the-((agent))-installation-package">Download and extract the ((agent)) installation package.</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="step-2-install-and-start-the-((agent))">Install and start the ((agent)).</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="step-3-configure-the-((agent))">Configure the ((agent)).</DocLink>

<div id="logs-stream-extract-agent"></div>

### Step 1: Download and extract the ((agent)) installation package

On your host, download and extract the installation package that corresponds with your system:

<DownloadWidget />

<div id="logs-stream-install-agent"></div>

### Step 2: Install and start the ((agent))
After downloading and extracting the installation package, you're ready to install the ((agent)). From the agent directory, run the install command that corresponds with your system:

<DocCallOut title="Note">
On macOS, Linux (tar package), and Windows, run the `install` command to
install and start ((agent)) as a managed service and start the service. The DEB and RPM
packages include a service unit for Linux systems with
systemd, For these systems, you must enable and start the service.
</DocCallOut>

<RunStandaloneWidget />

During installation, you're prompted with some questions:

1. When asked if you want to install the agent as a service, enter `Y`. 
1. When asked if you want to enroll the agent in Fleet, enter `n`.

<div id="logs-stream-agent-config"></div>

### Step 3: Configure the ((agent))

With your agent installed, configure it by updating the `elastic-agent.yml` file. 

<div id="logs-stream-yml-location"></div>

#### Locate your configuration file

After installing the agent, you'll find the `elastic-agent.yml` in one of the following locations according to your system:

<AgentLocationWidget />

<div id="logs-stream-example-config"></div>

#### Update your configuration file

The following is an example of a standalone ((agent)) configuration. To configure your ((agent)), replace the contents of the `elastic-agent.yml` file with this configuration:

```yaml
outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts: '<your-elasticsearch-endpoint>:<port>'
    api_key: 'your-api-key'
inputs:
  - id: your-log-id
    type: filestream
    streams:
      - id: your-log-stream-id
        data_stream.dataset: generic
        paths:
          - /var/log/your-logs.log
```

Next, set the values for these fields:

- `hosts` – Copy the ((es)) endpoint from your deployment's page and add the port (the default port is `443`). For example, `https://my-deployment.es.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:443`.

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* ![((es)) endpoint and cluster id location, 50%](images/logs-stream/-observability-es-endpoint-cluster-id.png) */}

- `api-key` – Use an API key to grant the agent access to ((es)). To create an API key for your agent, see [Create API keys for standalone agents](((fleet-guide))/grant-access-to-elasticsearch.html#create-api-key-standalone-agent).

<DocCallOut title="Note">
The API key format should be `<id>:<key>`. Make sure you selected **Beats** when you created your API key. Base64 encoded API keys are not currently supported in this configuration.
- `inputs.id` – A unique identifier for your input.
- `type` – The type of input. For collecting logs, set this to `filestream`.
- `streams.id` – A unique identifier for your stream of log data. 
- `data_stream.dataset` – The name for your dataset data stream. Name this data stream anything that signifies the source of the data. The default value is `generic`.
- `paths` – The path to your log files. You can also use a pattern like `/var/log/your-logs.log*`.
</DocCallOut>

<div id="logs-stream-restart-agent"></div>

#### Restart the ((agent))

After updating your configuration file, you need to restart the ((agent)):

First, stop the ((agent)) and its related executables using the command that works with your system:

<StopWidget />

Next, restart the ((agent)) using the command that works with your system:

<StartWidget />

<div id="logs-stream-query-datastreams"></div>

## View and search your data

With your ((agent)) and data streams configured, you can now view, filter, and search your log data. In ((kib)), navigate to **Observability → Logs → Stream**, and use the search bar to search for your `data_stream.type` and `data_stream.dataset`. 

See the following examples for ways to search specific data types and datasets:

- `data_stream.type: logs` – shows `logs` data streams.
- `data_stream.dataset: nginx.access` – shows data streams with an `nginx.access` dataset.

This example shows the search results for logs with an `apm.error` dataset and a `default` namespace:

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* ![example search query on the logs stream page in ((kib))](images/logs-stream/-observability-stream-logs-example.png) */}

<div id="logs-stream-troubleshooting"></div>

## Troubleshoot your ((agent)) configuration

If you're not seeing your log files in ((kib)), verify the following in the `elastic-agent.yml` file:

- The path to your logs file under `paths` is correct.
- Your API key is in `<id>:<key>` format. If not, your API key may be in an unsupported format, and you'll need to create an API key in **Beats** format. 

If you're still running into issues, see [((agent)) troubleshooting](((fleet-guide))/fleet-troubleshooting.html) and [Configure standalone Elastic Agents](((fleet-guide))/elastic-agent-configuration.html).

<div id="logs-stream-enhance-logs"></div>

## Get the most out of your log data

Make your logs more useful by extracting structured fields from your unstructured log data. Extracting structured fields makes it easier to search, analyze, and filter your log data. 

Let's look at this log example:

```log
2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.
```

Add this log to ((es)) using the following command in **Dev Tools**, found in your deployment in the left navigation under **Management**:

```console
POST logs-example-default/_doc
{
  "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%."
}
```

The previous command stores the document in `logs-example-default`. Retrieve it with the following search:

```console
GET /logs-example-default/_search
```

You see something like this:

```JSON
{
  ...
  "hits": {
    ...
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": ".ds-logs-example-default-2023.08.09-000001",
        ...
        "_source": {
          "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-09T17:19:27.73312243Z"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

((es)) indexes the `message` field by default meaning you can search for phrases like `WARN` or `Disk usage exceeds`. For example, the following command searches for the phrase `WARN` in the log `message` field:

```console
GET logs-example-default/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "message": {
        "query": "WARN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

While you can search for phrases in the `message` field, you can't use this field to filter log data. Your message, however, contains all of the following potential fields you can extract and use to filter and aggregate your log data:

- **@timestamp** – `2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z` – Extracting this field lets you sort logs by date and time. This is helpful when you want to view your logs in the order that they occurred or identify when issues happened.
- **log.level** – `WARN` – Extracting this field lets you filter logs by severity. This is helpful if you want to focus on high-severity WARN or ERROR-level logs, and reduce noise by filtering out low-severity INFO-level logs.
- **host.ip** – `192.168.1.101` – Extracting this field lets you filter logs by the host IP addresses. This is helpful if you want to focus on specific hosts that you’re having issues with or if you want to find disparities between hosts.
- **message** – `Disk usage exceeds 90%.` – You can search for keywords in the message field.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
These fields are part of the [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](((ecs-ref))/ecs-reference.html). The ECS defines a common set of fields that you can use across Elasticsearch when storing data, including log and metric data.
</DocCallOut>

<div id="logs-stream-extract-timestamp"></div>

### Extract the `@timestamp` field

When you ingested the document in the previous section, you'll notice the `@timestamp` field shows when you added the data to ((es)), not when the log occurred:

```JSON
        ...
        "_source": {
          "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-09T17:19:27.73312243Z"
        }
        ...
```

This section shows you how to extract the `@timestamp` field from the log message so you can filter by when the logs and issues actually occurred.

To extract the timestamp, you need to:

1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="use-an-ingest-pipeline-to-extract-the-timestamp">Use an ingest pipeline to extract the `@timestamp`</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="test-your-pipeline-with-the-simulate-pipeline-api">Test your pipeline with the simulate pipeline API</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="configure-your-data-stream-with-an-index-template">Configure your data stream with an index template</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="create-your-data-stream">Create your data stream</DocLink>

<div id="logs-stream-ingest-pipeline"></div>

#### Use an ingest pipeline to extract the `@timestamp`

Ingest pipelines consist of a series of processors that perform common transformations on incoming documents before they are indexed. To extract the `@timestamp` field from the example log, use an ingest pipeline with a dissect processor. The [dissect processor](((ref))/dissect-processor.html) extracts structured fields from unstructured log messages based on a pattern you set. 

((es)) can parse string timestamps that are in `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ` and `yyyy-MM-dd` formats into date fields. Since the log example's timestamp is in one of these formats, you don't need additional processors. More complex or nonstandard timestamps require a [date processor](((ref))/date-processor.html) to parse the timestamp into a date field. Date processors can also set the timezone, change the target field, and change the output format of the timestamp.

In the following command, the dissect processor extracts the timestamp from the `message` field to the `@timestamp` field and leaves the rest of the message in the `message` field:

```console
PUT _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default
{
  "description": "Extracts the timestamp",
  "processors": [
    {
      "dissect": {
        "field": "message",
        "pattern": "%{@timestamp} %{message}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The previous command sets the following values for your ingest pipeline:

- `_ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default` – The name of the pipeline,`logs-example-default`, needs to match the name of your data stream. You'll set up your data stream in the next section. See the [data stream naming scheme](((fleet-guide))/data-streams.html#data-streams-naming-scheme) for more information.
- `field` – The field you're extracting data from, `message` in this case.
- `pattern`– The pattern of the elements in your log data. The following pattern extracts the timestamp, `2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z`, to the `@timestamp` field, while the rest of the message, `WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.`, stays in the `message` field. The dissect processor looks for the space as a separator defined by the pattern `%{timestamp} %{message}`.

<div id="logs-stream-simulate-api"></div>

#### Test your pipeline with the simulate pipeline API

The [simulate pipeline API](((ref))/simulate-pipeline-api.html#ingest-verbose-param) runs the ingest pipeline without storing any documents. This lets you verify your pipeline works using multiple documents. Run the following command to test your ingest pipeline with the simulate pipeline API.

```console
POST _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default/_simulate
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_source": {
        "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The results should show the `@timestamp` field extracted from the `message` field:

```console
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "doc": {
        "_index": "_index",
        "_id": "_id",
        "_version": "-3",
        "_source": {
          "message": "WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z"
        },
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<DocCallOut title="Note">
Make sure you've created the index pipeline using the `PUT` command in the previous section before using the simulate pipeline API.
</DocCallOut>

<div id="logs-stream-index-template"></div>

#### Configure your data stream with an index template

After creating your ingest pipeline, create an index template to point your log data to your pipeline using this command:

```console
PUT _index_template/logs-example-default-template
{
  "index_patterns": [ "logs-example-*" ],
  "data_stream": { },
  "priority": 500,
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "index.default_pipeline":"logs-example"
    }
  },
  "composed_of": [
    "logs-mappings",
    "logs-settings",
    "logs@custom",
    "ecs@dynamic_templates"
  ],
  "ignore_missing_component_templates": ["logs@custom"],
}
```

The previous command sets the following values for your index template:

- `index_patterns`– The index pattern needs to match your log data stream. Naming conventions for data streams are `<type>-<dataset>-<namespace>`. In this example, your logs data stream is named `logs-example-default`. Data that matches this pattern will go through your pipeline.
- `data_stream` – Enables data streams.
- `priority` – Index templates with higher priority take precedence over lower priority. If a data stream matches multiple index templates, ((es)) uses the template with the higher priority. Built-in templates have a priority of `200`, so use a priority higher than `200` for custom templates.
- `index.default_pipeline` – The name of your ingest pipeline. `logs-example-default` in this case.
- `composed_of` – Here you can set component templates. Component templates are building blocks for constructing index templates that specify index mappings, settings, and aliases. Elastic has several built-in templates that help when ingesting your data.

The component templates that are set in the previous index template are defined as follows:

- `logs-mappings` – general mappings for logs data streams that includes disabling automatic date detection from `string` fields and specifying mappings for [`data_stream` ECS fields](((ecs-ref))/ecs-data_stream.html).
- `logs-settings` – Sets the general settings for logs data streams including the default lifecycle policy and default pipeline: 
    * The default lifecycle policy rolls over when the primary shard reaches 50 GB or after 30 days.
    * The default pipeline:
        * Sets a `@timestamp` if there isn't one using the ingest timestamp.
        * Places a hook for the `logs@custom` pipeline. If a `logs@custom` pipeline is installed, it's applied to logs ingested into this data stream.
    * Sets the [`ignore_malformed`](((ref))/ignore-malformed.html) flag to `true`. If a field in the log document contains an incorrect value type and the field's mapping type supports this flag, the document is still processed.
        - `logs@custom` – a predefined component template that is not installed by default. Use this name to install a custom component template if you wish to override or extend any of the default mappings or settings.
        - `ecs@dynamic_templates` – dynamic templates that automatically ensure your data stream mappings comply with the [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](((ecs-ref))/ecs-reference.html).

<div id="logs-stream-create-data-stream"></div>

#### Create your data stream

Create your data stream using the [data stream naming scheme](((fleet-guide))/data-streams.html#data-streams-naming-scheme). Since The name needs to match the name of your pipeline, name the data stream `logs-example-default`. Post the example log to your data stream with this command:

```console
POST logs-example-default/_doc
{
  "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%."
}
```

View your documents using this command:

```console
GET /logs-example-default/_search
```

You should see the pipeline has extracted the `@timestamp` field:

```JSON
{
...
{
  ...
  "hits": {
    ...
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": ".ds-logs-example-default-2023.08.09-000001",
        "_id": "RsWy3IkB8yCtA5VGOKLf",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "message": "WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can now use the `@timestamp` field to sort your logs by the date and time they happened.

<div id="logs-stream-timestamp-troubleshooting"></div>

#### Troubleshoot your `@timestamp` field

Check the following common issues and solutions with timestamps:

- **Timestamp failure** – If your data has inconsistent date formats, set `ignore_failure` to `true` for your date processor. This processes logs with correctly formatted dates and ignores those with issues.
- **Incorrect timezone** – Set your timezone using the `timezone` option on the [date processor](((ref))/date-processor.html).
- **Incorrect timestamp format** – Your timestamp can be a Java time pattern or one of the following formats: ISO8601, UNIX, UNIX_MS, or TAI64N. See the [mapping date format](((ref))/mapping-date-format.html) for more information on timestamp formats.

<div id="logs-stream-extract-log-level"></div>

### Extract the `log.level` field

Extracting the `log.level` field lets you filter by severity and focus on critical issues. This section shows you how to extract the `log.level` field from this example log:

```log
2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.
```

To extract and use the `log.level` field:

1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="add-loglevel-to-your-ingest-pipeline">Add the `log.level` field to the dissect processor pattern in your ingest pipeline.</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="test-the-pipeline-with-the-simulate-api">Test the pipeline with the simulate API.</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="query-logs-based-on-loglevel">Query your logs based on the `log.level` field.</DocLink>

<div id="logs-stream-log-level-pipeline"></div>

#### Add `log.level` to your ingest pipeline

Add the `%{log.level}` option to the dissect processor pattern in the ingest pipeline you created in the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="use-an-ingest-pipeline-to-extract-the-timestamp">Extract the `@timestamp` field</DocLink> section:

```console
PUT _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default
{
  "description": "Extracts the timestamp and log level",
  "processors": [
    {
      "dissect": {
        "field": "message",
        "pattern": "%{@timestamp} %{log.level} %{message}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Now your pipeline will extract these fields:

- The `@timestamp` field – `2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z`
- The `log.level` field – `WARN`
- The `message` field – `192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.`

After creating your pipeline, an index template points your log data to your pipeline. Use the index template you created in the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="configure-your-data-stream-with-an-index-template">Extract the `@timestamp` field</DocLink> section.

<div id="logs-stream-log-level-simulate"></div>

#### Test the pipeline with the simulate API

Test that your ingest pipeline works as expected with the [simulate pipeline API](((ref))/simulate-pipeline-api.html#ingest-verbose-param):

```console
POST _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default/_simulate
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_source": {
        "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The results should show the `@timestamp` and the `log.level` fields extracted from the `message` field:

```JSON
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "doc": {
        "_index": "_index",
        "_id": "_id",
        "_version": "-3",
        "_source": {
          "message": "192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "log": {
            "level": "WARN"
          },
          "@timestamp": "2023-8-08T13:45:12.123Z",
        },
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<div id="logs-stream-log-level-query"></div>

#### Query logs based on `log.level`

Once you've extracted the `log.level` field, you can query for high-severity logs like `WARN` and `ERROR`, which may need immediate attention, and filter out less critical `INFO` and `DEBUG` logs.

Let's say you have the following logs with varying severities:

```log
2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.
2023-08-08T13:45:14.003Z ERROR 192.168.1.103 Database connection failed.
2023-08-08T13:45:15.004Z DEBUG 192.168.1.104 Debugging connection issue.
2023-08-08T13:45:16.005Z INFO 192.168.1.102 User changed profile picture.
```

Add them to your data stream using this command:

```console
POST logs-example-default/_bulk
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%." }
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:14.003Z ERROR 192.168.1.103 Database connection failed." }
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:15.004Z DEBUG 192.168.1.104 Debugging connection issue." }
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:16.005Z INFO 192.168.1.102 User changed profile picture." }
```

Then, query for documents with a log level of `WARN` or `ERROR` with this command: 

```console
GET logs-example-default/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "log.level": ["WARN", "ERROR"]
    }
  }
}
```

You should see the following results showing only your high-severity logs:

```JSON
{
...

<div id="logs-stream-extract-host-ip"></div>

### Extract the `host.ip` field

Extracting the `host.ip` field lets you filter logs by host IP addresses allowing you to focus on specific hosts that you're having issues with or find disparities between hosts. 

The `host.ip` field is part of the [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](((ecs-ref))/ecs-reference.html). Through the ECS, the `host.ip` field is mapped as an [`ip` field type](((ref))/ip.html). `ip` field types allow range queries so you can find logs with IP addresses in a specific range. You can also query `ip` field types using CIDR notation to find logs from a particular network or subnet.

This section shows you how to extract the `host.ip` field from the following example logs and query based on the extracted fields:

```log
2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.
2023-08-08T13:45:14.003Z ERROR 192.168.1.103 Database connection failed.
2023-08-08T13:45:15.004Z DEBUG 192.168.1.104 Debugging connection issue.
2023-08-08T13:45:16.005Z INFO 192.168.1.102 User changed profile picture.
```

To extract and use the `host.ip` field:

1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="add-hostip-to-your-ingest-pipeline">Add the `host.ip` field to your dissect processor in your ingest pipeline.</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="test-the-pipeline-with-the-simulate-api">Test the pipeline with the simulate API.</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="query-logs-based-on-hostip">Query your logs based on the `host.ip` field.</DocLink>

<div id="logs-stream-host-ip-pipeline"></div>

#### Add `host.ip` to your ingest pipeline

Add the `%{host.ip}` option to the dissect processor pattern in the ingest pipeline you created in the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="use-an-ingest-pipeline-to-extract-the-timestamp">Extract the `@timestamp` field</DocLink> section:

```console
PUT _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default
{
  "description": "Extracts the timestamp log level and host ip",
  "processors": [
    {
      "dissect": {
        "field": "message",
        "pattern": "%{@timestamp} %{log.level} %{host.ip} %{message}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Your pipeline will extract these fields:

- The `@timestamp` field – `2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z`
- The `log.level` field – `WARN`
- The `host.ip` field – `192.168.1.101`
- The `message` field – `Disk usage exceeds 90%.`

After creating your pipeline, an index template points your log data to your pipeline. Use the index template you created in the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="configure-your-data-stream-with-an-index-template">Extract the `@timestamp` field</DocLink> section.

<div id="logs-stream-host-ip-simulate"></div>

#### Test the pipeline with the simulate API

Test that your ingest pipeline works as expected with the [simulate pipeline API](((ref))/simulate-pipeline-api.html#ingest-verbose-param):

```console
POST _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default/_simulate
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_source": {
        "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The results should show the `host.ip`, `@timestamp`, and `log.level` fields extracted from the `message` field:

```JSON
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "doc": {
        ...
        "_source": {
          "host": {
            "ip": "192.168.1.101"
          },
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z",
          "message": "Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "log": {
            "level": "WARN"
          }
        },
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<div id="logs-stream-host-ip-query"></div>

#### Query logs based on `host.ip`

You can query your logs based on the `host.ip` field in different ways, including using CIDR notation and range queries. 

Before querying your logs, add them to your data stream using this command:

```console
POST logs-example-default/_bulk
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%." }
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:14.003Z ERROR 192.168.1.103 Database connection failed." }
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:15.004Z DEBUG 192.168.1.104 Debugging connection issue." }
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:16.005Z INFO 192.168.1.102 User changed profile picture." }
```

<div id="logs-stream-ip-cidr"></div>

##### CIDR notation 

You can use [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation) to query your log data using a block of IP addresses that fall within a certain network segment. CIDR notations uses the format of `[IP address]/[prefix length]`. The following command queries IP addresses in the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet meaning IP addresses from `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.255`.

```console
GET logs-example-default/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "host.ip": "192.168.1.0/24"
    }
  }
}
```

Because all of the example logs are in this range, you'll get the following results:

```JSON
{
  ...
  },
  "hits": {
    ...
      {
        "_index": ".ds-logs-example-default-2023.08.16-000001",

          }
        }
      },

          },
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-08T13:45:16.005Z",
          "message": "User changed profile picture.",
          "log": {
            "level": "INFO"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<div id="logs-stream-range-query"></div>

##### Range queries

Use [range queries](((ref))/query-dsl-range-query.html) to query logs in a specific range. 

The following command searches for IP addresses greater than or equal to `192.168.1.100` and less than or equal to `192.168.1.102`.

```console
GET logs-example-default/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "host.ip": {
        "gte": "192.168.1.100",
        "lte": "192.168.1.102"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You'll get the following results matching the range you've set:

```JSON
{
  ...
  },
  "hits": {
    ...
      {
        "_index": ".ds-logs-example-default-2023.08.16-000001",
        "_id": "ak4oAIoBl7fe5ItIixuB",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "host": {
            "ip": "192.168.1.101"
          },
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z",
          "message": "Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "log": {
            "level": "WARN"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": ".ds-logs-example-default-2023.08.16-000001",
        "_id": "bU4oAIoBl7fe5ItIixuC",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "host": {
            "ip": "192.168.1.102"
          },
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-08T13:45:16.005Z",
          "message": "User changed profile picture.",
          "log": {
            "level": "INFO"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<div id="logs-stream-ip-ignore-malformed"></div>

#### Ignore malformed IP addresses

When you're ingesting a large batch of log data, a single malformed IP address can cause the entire batch to fail. Prevent this by setting `ignore_malformed` to `true` for the `host.ip` field. Update the `host.ip` field to ignore malformed IPs using the [update mapping API](((ref))/indices-put-mapping.html):

```console
PUT /logs-example-default/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "host.ip": {
      "type": "ip",
      "ignore_malformed": true
    }
  }
}
```

<div id="logs-stream-reroute"></div>

## Reroute log data to specific data stream

<DocCallOut template="technical_preview" />
By default, an ingest pipeline sends your log data to a single data stream. To simplify log data management, use a [reroute processor](((ref))/reroute-processor.html) to route data from the generic data stream to a target data stream. For example, you might want to send high-severity logs to a specific data stream to help with categorization. 

This section shows you how to use a reroute processor to send the high-severity logs (`WARN` or `ERROR`) from the following example logs to a specific data stream and keep the regular logs (`DEBUG` and `INFO`) in the default data stream:

```log
2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.
2023-08-08T13:45:14.003Z ERROR 192.168.1.103 Database connection failed.
2023-08-08T13:45:15.004Z DEBUG 192.168.1.104 Debugging connection issue.
2023-08-08T13:45:16.005Z INFO 192.168.1.102 User changed profile picture.
```

<DocCallOut title="Note">
When routing data to different data streams, we recommend keeping the number of data streams relatively low to avoid oversharding. See [Size your shards](((ref))/size-your-shards.html) for more information.
</DocCallOut>

To use a reroute processor:

1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="add-a-reroute-processor-to-your-ingest-pipeline">Add a reroute processor to your ingest pipeline.</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="add-logs-to-your-data-stream">Add the example logs to your data stream.</DocLink>
1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="verify-that-the-reroute-processor-worked">Query your logs and verify the high-severity logs were routed to the new data stream.</DocLink>

<div id="logs-stream-reroute-pipeline"></div>

#### Add a reroute processor to your ingest pipeline

Add a reroute processor to your ingest pipeline with the following command:

```console
PUT _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default
{
  "description": "Extracts fields and reroutes WARN",
  "processors": [
    {
      "dissect": {
        "field": "message",
        "pattern": "%{@timestamp} %{log.level} %{host.ip} %{message}"
      },
      "reroute": {
        "tag": "high_severity_logs",
        "if" : "ctx.log?.level == 'WARN' || ctx.log?.level == 'ERROR'",
        "dataset": "critical"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The previous command sets the following values for your reroute processor:

- `tag` – Identifier for the processor that you can use for debugging and metrics. In the example, the tag is set to `high_severity_logs`.
- `if` – Conditionally runs the processor. In the example, `"ctx.log?.level == 'WARN' || ctx.log?.level == 'ERROR'",` means the processor runs when the `log.level` field is `WARN` or `ERROR`.
- `dataset` – the data stream dataset to route your document to if the previous condition is `true`. In the example, logs with a `log.level` of `WARN` or `ERROR` are routed to the `logs-critical-default` data stream.

After creating your pipeline, an index template points your log data to your pipeline. Use the index template you created in the <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityStreamLogFiles" section="configure-your-data-stream-with-an-index-template">Extract the `@timestamp` field</DocLink> section.

<div id="logs-stream-reroute-add-logs"></div>

#### Add logs to your data stream

Add the example logs to your data stream with this command:

```console
POST logs-example-default/_bulk
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%." }
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:14.003Z ERROR 192.168.1.103 Database connection failed." }
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:15.004Z DEBUG 192.168.1.104 Debugging connection issue." }
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:16.005Z INFO 192.168.1.102 User changed profile picture." }
```

<div id="logs-stream-reroute-verify"></div>

#### Verify that the reroute processor worked

The reroute processor should route any logs with a `log.level` of `WARN` or `ERROR` to the `logs-critical-default` data stream. Query the the data stream using the following command to verify the log data was routed as intended:

```console
GET log-critical-default/_search
```

Your query should return similar results to the following:

```JSON
{
  ...
  "hits": {
    ...
    "hits": [
        ...
        "_source": {
          "host": {
            "ip": "192.168.1.101"
          },
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z",
          "message": "Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "log": {
            "level": "WARN"
          },
          "data_stream": {
            "namespace": "default",
            "type": "logs",
            "dataset": "critical"
          },
          {
        ...
        "_source": {
          "host": {
            "ip": "192.168.1.103"
           },
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-08T13:45:14.003Z",
          "message": "Database connection failed.",
          "log": {
            "level": "ERROR"
          },
          "data_stream": {
            "namespace": "default",
            "type": "logs",
            "dataset": "critical"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can see the high-severity logs and that they're now in the `critical` dataset.
