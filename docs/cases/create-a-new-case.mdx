<div id="create-a-new-case"></div>

Open a new case to keep track of issues and share the details with colleagues.

1. Go to **Cases** -> **Create new case**.
1. Give the case a name, severity, and description.

    <DocCallOut title="Tip">
    In the `Description` area, you can use
    [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) syntax to create formatted text.
    </DocCallOut>

1. Optionally, add a category, assignees, and tags.
    You can add users only if they meet the necessary <DocBadge><DocIcon size="s" type="unlink" title="missing link"/> missing link</DocBadge>{/*  <DocLink id="enObservabilityGrantCasesAccess">prerequisites</DocLink> */}.

1. Under External incident management system, select a <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilitySendCasesToAnExternalSystem">connector</DocLink>. If
    you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the
    default setting is `No connector selected`.

1. After you've completed all of the required fields, click **Create case**.

<div id="add-observability-case-files"></div>

## Add files

After you create a case, you can upload and manage files on the **Files** tab:

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#F1F4FA", width: "100%", height: "250px", textAlign: "center", paddingTop: "110px", marginBottom: "20px" }}><DocIcon type="image" title="missing image"/> missing image</div>
{/* ![A list of files attached to a case](images/manage-cases/-observability-case-files.png) */}
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}


{/* TODO: Find out if it's possible to configure mime types and max file sizes in serverless. If not, we should at least document what is supported.*/}
{/*The acceptable file types and sizes are affected by your [((kib)) case settings](((kibana-ref))/cases-settings.html). */}

When you upload a file, a comment is added to the case activity log.
To view an image, click its name in the activity or file list.

<DocCallOut title="Note">

Uploaded files are also accessible under **Project settings -> **Management** > Files**.
When you export cases as [saved objects](((kibana-ref))/managing-saved-objects.html), the case files are not exported.

</DocCallOut>

<div id="add-case-notifications"></div>

## Add email notifications

{/* TODO: Clean up this section. It points to docs about watcher, which just seems wrong. */}

You can configure email notifications that occur when users are assigned to
cases. To do this, add the email addresses to the monitoring email allowlist. Follow the steps in
[Send alerts by email](((cloud))/ec-watcher.html#ec-watcher-allowlist).

You do not need to configure an email connector or update
user settings, since the preconfigured Elastic-Cloud-SMTP connector is
used by default.

When you subsequently add assignees to cases, they receive an email.

<div id="manage-case-observability"></div>

## Manage existing cases

You can search existing cases and filter them by attributes such as assignees,
categories, severity, status, and tags. You can also select multiple cases and use bulk
actions to delete cases or change their attributes.

To view a case, click on its name. You can then:

* Add a new comment.
* Edit existing comments and the description.
* Add or remove assignees.
* Add a <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilitySendCasesToAnExternalSystem">connector</DocLink> (if you did not select one while creating the case).
* Send updates to external systems (if external connections are configured).
* Edit the category and tags.
* Change the status.
* Change the severity.
* Remove an alert.
* Refresh the case to retrieve the latest updates.
* Close the case.
* Reopen a closed case.
