You can send cases to these third-party systems:

* ((ibm-r))
* ((jira)) (including ((jira)) Service Desk)
* ((sn-itsm))
* ((sn-sir))
* ((swimlane))
* ((webhook-cm))

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
{/* TODO: Verify user roles needed to create connectors... */}
To add, modify, or delete a connector, you must have the Admin user role for the project
(or a more permissive role).
</DocCallOut>

You need to create a connector to send cases, which stores the information required to interact
with an external system.

After creating a connector, you can set your cases to
automatically close when they are sent to an external system.

## Create a connector

1. Go to **Cases** -> **Settings**.
1. From the **Incident management system** list, select **Add new connector**.
1. Select the system to send cases to: **((sn))**, **((jira))**, **((ibm-r))**, **((swimlane))**,
    or **((webhook-cm))**.

1. Enter your required settings. For connector configuration details, refer to:
   -  [((ibm-r)) connector](((kibana-ref))/resilient-action-type.html)
   -  [((jira)) connector](((kibana-ref))/jira-action-type.html)
   -  [((sn-itsm)) connector](((kibana-ref))/servicenow-action-type.html)
   -  [((sn-sir)) connector](((kibana-ref))/servicenow-sir-action-type.html)
   -  [((swimlane)) connector](((kibana-ref))/swimlane-action-type.html)
   -  [((webhook-cm)) connector](((kibana-ref))/cases-webhook-action-type.html)

1. Click **Save**.

## Edit a connector

You can create additional connectors, update existing connectors, and change the connector used to send cases to external systems.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
You can also configure which connector is used for each case individually. Refer to <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCreateANewCase"/>.
</DocCallOut>

To change the default connector used to send cases to external systems:

1. Go to **Cases** -> **Settings**.
1. Select the required connector from the **Incident management system** list.

To update an existing connector:

1. Click **Update \<connector name>**.
1. Update the connector fields as required.

## Close sent cases automatically

To close cases when they are sent to an external system, select
**Automatically close cases when pushing new incident to external system**.
