<div id="slo-burn-rate-alert"></div>

You can create an SLO burn rate rule to alert you when your SLO burn rate is too high over a defined period of time. Choose which SLO to monitor and then define multiple burn rate windows with appropriate severity. For each period, the burn rate is computed as the error rate divided by the error budget. When the burn rates for both periods surpass the threshold, an alert is triggered. 

<DocAccordion buttonContent="About rules and alerts">
    First you must define the rule and how often it should be evaluated. To turn this into an alert, add an appropriate action (e.g. send email, create issue) to be triggered when the rule conditions are met. You can create any rules and alerts from scratch using the **Manage Rules** page, or you can start from any page within **Applications** and benefit from some of the details being pre-filled e.g. Name, Tags.

To create your SLO burn rate rule::

1. Select **Manage Rules** from the **Alerts** page, and select **Create rule**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your rule, and any optional **Tags** for more granular reporting (leave blank if unsure).
1. Select the **SLO burn rate** rule type from the SLO use case.
1. Select the SLO you want to monitor.
1. Define multiple burn rate windows for each **Action Group** (defaults to 4 windows but you can edit):
    * **Lookback (hours)**: .
    * **Burn rate threshold**: .
    * **Action Group**: .
1. Define the interval to check the rule e.g. check every 1 minute.
1. **Save** your rule, or add an action to create an alert for this rule.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
    You can add an action to a rule at any time. You can create rules without adding actions, and you can also define multiple actions for a single rule. To add actions to rules, you must first create a connector for that service (e.g. email, external incident management system), which you can then use for different rules, each with their own action frequency. For more information on creating connectors, refer to <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilitySendCasesToAnExternalSystem">Send cases to an external system</DocLink>.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="To create an alert by adding an action to a rule:" initialIsOpen>
1. Either create a rule from scratch or select **Edit rule** from an existing rule.
1. Under **Actions**, select a connector type from the available options.
1. If you have connectors of that type already created, you can select from the available connectors. If you need to add a new connector, select **Create a connector** and refer to <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilitySendCasesToAnExternalSystem">Connectors</DocLink> for more information.
1. For each action you must define the **Action frequency** by choosing between **For each alert** or **Summary of alerts**:
    * **For each alert**: Choose **On status changes** or **On check intervals**, or **On custom action intervals** and define how often to run. For all three options you must also define if **Run when** _Threshold met_ or _Recovered_.
    * **Summary of alerts**: Choose **On check intervals**, or **On custom action intervals** and define how often to run.
1. Select **Save**.
