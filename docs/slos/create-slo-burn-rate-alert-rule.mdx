Create an SLO burn rate rule to get alerts when the burn rate is too high over a defined threshold for two different lookback periods: a long period and a short period that is 1/12th of the long period. For example, if your long lookback period is one hour, your short lookback period is five minutes. 

Choose which SLO to monitor and then define multiple burn rate windows with appropriate severity. For each period, the burn rate is computed as the error rate divided by the error budget. When the burn rates for both periods surpass the threshold, an alert is triggered. Add actions to raise alerts via services or third-party integrations e.g. mail, Slack, Jira.

To create an SLO burn rate rule:

1. Select **Manage Rules** from the **Alerts** page, and select **Create rule**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your rule, and any optional **Tags** for more granular reporting (leave blank if unsure).
1. Select **SLO burn rate** from the **Select rule type** list.
1. Select the **SLO** you want to monitor.
1. Define multiple burn rate windows for each **Action Group** (defaults to 4 windows but you can edit):
    * **Lookback (hours)**: Enter the lookback period for this window. A shorter period equal to 1/12th of this period will be used for faster recovery.
    * **Burn rate threshold**: Enter a burn rate for this window.
    * **Action Group**: Select a severity for this window.
1. Define the interval to check the rule e.g. check every 1 minute.
1. (Optional) Set up **Actions**.
1. **Save** your rule.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
You can also create an SLO burn rate rule directly from **Observability -> SLOs**. Click the more options icon (<DocIcon type="boxesVertical" title="More options" />) to the right of the SLO you want to add a burn rate rule for, and select **<DocIcon type="bell" title="Bell" /> Create new alert rule** from the menu. When you create a new SLO you will also be prompted to make an SLO burn rate rule upon completion of the SLO.

## Actions

You can extend your rules with actions that interact with third-party systems, write to logs or indices, or send user notifications. You can add an action to a rule at any time. You can create rules without adding actions, and you can also define multiple actions for a single rule. 

To add actions to rules, you must first create a connector for that service (for example, an email or external incident management system), which you can then use for different rules, each with their own action frequency. For more information on creating connectors, refer to <DocLink id="serverlessActionConnectors">Connectors</DocLink>.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Action types">
Actions are services or integrations with third-party systems that run as background tasks when rule conditions are met. The following built-in integrations are supported:

</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Action frequency">
After you select a connector, you must set the action frequency. You can choose to create a **Summary of alerts** on each check interval or on a custom interval. For example, you can send email notifications that summarize the new, ongoing, and recovered alerts every twelve hours.

Alternatively, you can set the action frequency to **For each alert** and specify the conditions each alert must meet for the action to run. For example, you can send an email only when the alert status changes to critical.

![Configure when a rule is triggered](../images/alert-action-frequency.png)

With the **Run when** menu you can choose if an action runs for a specific severity (critical, high, medium, low), or when the alert is recovered. For example, you can add a corresponding action for each severity you want an alert for, and also for when the alert recovers.

Use the default notification message or customize it.
You can add more context to the message by clicking the Add variable icon <DocIcon type="indexOpen" title="Add variable" /> and selecting from a list of available variables.
