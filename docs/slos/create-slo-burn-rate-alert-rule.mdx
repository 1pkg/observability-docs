<Testing />

You can create an SLO burn rate rule to get alerts when the burn rate is too high over a defined threshold for two different lookback periods: a long period and a short period that is 1/12th of the long period. For example, if your long lookback period is one hour, your short lookback period is five minutes. 

Choose which SLO to monitor and then define multiple burn rate windows with appropriate severity. For each period, the burn rate is computed as the error rate divided by the error budget. When the burn rates for both periods surpass the threshold, an alert is triggered.

To create an SLO burn rate rule:

1. Select **Manage Rules** from the **Alerts** page, and select **Create rule**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your rule, and any optional **Tags** for more granular reporting (leave blank if unsure).
1. Select the **SLO burn rate** rule type from the SLO use case.
1. Select the SLO you want to monitor.
1. Define multiple burn rate windows for each **Action Group** (defaults to 4 windows but you can edit):
    * **Lookback (hours)**: Enter the lookback period for this window. 
    * **Burn rate threshold**: .
    * **Action Group**: .
1. Define the interval to check the rule e.g. check every 1 minute.
1. (Optional) Set up **Actions**.
1. **Save** your rule.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
You can also create an SLO burn rate rule directly form **Observability -> SLOs**. Click the more options icon (<DocIcon type="boxesVertical" title="More options" />) to the right of the SLO you want to add a burn rate rule for, and select **<DocIcon type="bell" title="Bell" /> Create new alert rule** from the menu. When you create a new SLO you will also be prompted to make an SLO burn rate rule upon completion of the SLO.

## Actions

You can extend your rules by connecting them to **Actions** that use the following supported built-in integrations.

### Action types

Actions are services or integrations with third-party systems that run as background tasks when rule conditions are met.

### Action frequency

After you select a connector, you must set the action frequency. You can choose to create a **Summary of alerts** on each check interval or on a custom interval. For example, you can send email notifications that summarize the new, ongoing, and recovered alerts every twelve hours.

Alternatively, you can set the action frequency to **For each alert** and specify the conditions each alert must meet for the action to run. For example, you can send an email only when the alert status changes to critical.

### Action variables

Use the default notification message or customize it.
You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box
and selecting from a list of available variables.
