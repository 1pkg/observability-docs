You can create an SLO burn rate rule to get alerts when the burn rate is too high over a defined threshold for two different lookback periods: a long period and a short period that is 1/12th of the long period. For example, if your long lookback period is one hour, your short lookback period is five minutes. 

Choose which SLO to monitor and then define multiple burn rate windows with appropriate severity. For each period, the burn rate is computed as the error rate divided by the error budget. When the burn rates for both periods surpass the threshold, an alert is triggered. Add actions to raise alerts via services or third-party integrations e.g. mail, Slack, Jira.

To create an SLO burn rate rule:

1. Select **Manage Rules** from the **Alerts** page, and select **Create rule**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your rule, and any optional **Tags** for more granular reporting (leave blank if unsure).
1. Select the **SLO burn rate** rule type from the SLO use case.
1. Select the **SLO** you want to monitor.
1. Define multiple burn rate windows for each **Action Group** (defaults to 4 windows but you can edit):
    * **Lookback (hours)**: Enter the lookback period for this window. A shorter period equal to 1/12th of this period will be used for faster recovery.
    * **Burn rate threshold**: Enter a burn rate for this window.
    * **Action Group**: Select a severity for this window.
1. Define the interval to check the rule e.g. check every 1 minute.
1. (Optional) Set up **Actions**.
1. **Save** your rule.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
You can also create an SLO burn rate rule directly from **Observability -> SLOs**. Click the more options icon (<DocIcon type="boxesVertical" title="More options" />) to the right of the SLO you want to add a burn rate rule for, and select **<DocIcon type="bell" title="Bell" /> Create new alert rule** from the menu. When you create a new SLO you will also be prompted to make an SLO burn rate rule upon completion of the SLO.
