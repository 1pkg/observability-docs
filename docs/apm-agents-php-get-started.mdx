1. Download the agent source from https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-php/.
1. Execute the following commands to build the agent and install it:

```bash
cd src/ext
phpize
CFLAGS="-std=gnu99" ./configure --enable-elastic_apm
make clean
make
sudo make install
```

Enable the extension by adding the following to your `php.ini` file:

```php
extension=elastic_apm.so
elastic_apm.bootstrap_php_part_file=<repo root>/src/bootstrap_php_part.php
```

To work, the agent needs both the built `elastic_apm.so`
and the downloaded source files.
So if you would like to build `elastic_apm.so` on one machine and
then deploy it on a different machine, you will need to copy both
the built `elastic_apm.so` and the downloaded source files.
